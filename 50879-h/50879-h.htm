<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="d3" />

<p>Next to seeing a foreign land with one’s own
eyes is seeing it through the eyes of an intelligent,
appreciative countryman. The word is purposely
chosen, because one wishes to know what is
observed and thought by a person who has tastes,
sympathies and views in common with himself.
A thousand things in a strange country are
interesting and in different degrees. One studies
historically, another socially, another politically,
another ecclesiastically, while unfortunately not a
few rush pell-mell bringing back the most superficial
and indistinct impressions. Some find most
satisfaction in architecture, while others have
their chiefest enjoyment in sculpture, in painting,
in natural scenery, in costumes and customs. No
two have precisely the same fancies, and yet an
observant, cultivated countryman is more likely
to please us by what he likes and describes than
is a foreigner whose point of view and whose
mental habitudes are so different from our own.
What is most pleasing in a book of travels is wide
and varied observation, is an account of several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
countries inhabited by different races and distinguished
by marked peculiarities.</p>

<p>This volume embraces a wide extent of travel,
and includes an account of visits to Great Britain,
Switzerland, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Palestine,
Egypt, etc. The full table of contents is a little
misleading, for the chapters pertaining to Europe
are short, and Palestine takes up a considerable
portion of the work. The author, avoiding what
is dry or didactic, manages to compress into his
pages much valuable and trustworthy information.
His own religious denomination, naturally and
properly, is not overlooked, and from eminent
men he has succeeded in obtaining monographs
which give interesting facts, drawn from most
authentic sources. The portraitures of men, of
whom everybody wishes to know more, constitute
an interesting feature of the book.</p>

<p>The journey was not a mere vacation tour, a
hasty gallop to points visited by circular tourists,
but it comprised many months of patient toil, nor
were the countries seen from the windows of the
car of an express train. Lubboch, in his essay on
the Pleasures of Travel, says that some think
that every one should travel on foot “like Thales,
Plato and Pythagoras.” Mr. Whittle is a pedestrian
by choice, full of enterprise, activity, courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
and enthusiasm, and on foot he deviated often
from the beaten paths, and had opportunities for
careful examination of objects of interest and for
much pleasant and instructive intercourse with
the “common people.” With an eye quick to discern
what was peculiar, with an unquenchable
thirst for knowledge, he combined a cheerful disposition,
a ready appreciation of the humorous,
and has succeeded in giving the public a volume,
every page of which is interesting.</p>

<p>Travel, as a means of improvement, of education,
of broadening horizon, of getting us out of narrow
ruts, can hardly be overestimated. A visit to
Europe, Africa and Asia makes objective what
was subjective, and gives realism to what was
before vaguely in our memories. Some acquaintance
with geography, with history, literature, art,
enhances the interest and the profit. A young
student who had visited Jerusalem was much
flattered by a request from Humboldt to call and
see him. The <i>savant</i> soon showed that from
reading and inquiry he had more knowledge of
the city than the youth had acquired by his visit.
With some mortification and a little petulance
the young man said: “I understood, sir, that you
had never visited the Holy City.” “True,” replied
Humboldt, “I never have; but I once got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
ready to go.” Mr. Whittle, with wise forethought,
had made preparation for his visit. He knew
what he wanted to see, traveled with a purpose,
and has so imparted to his readers what he
learned and observed that one catches in part
the enthusiasm of the traveler.</p>

<h2 class="p4">PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="d3" />

<p>“Around the World in Eighty Days” has had
an extensive circulation, especially in America.
The title is striking. Our people like to do things
quickly. Many of them would be glad to girdle
the globe in forty days. They forget that “what
is worth doing at all is worth doing well.” Under
the patronage of Tourist Agencies it has become
quite fashionable of late to <i>do Europe in three
months</i>. These flying trips do perhaps result in
some good to the tourist, but they are valuable
chiefly to the agencies under which they are
made.</p>

<p>Traveling is no child’s play. Sight seeing when
properly done is hard work, but hard work is the
kind of work that pays best in the long run. To
see any country aright and understand it correctly
one must not merely visit its fashionable watering
places, large cities, splendid abbeys and cathedrals,
noted art galleries, museums, etc. He must see
these things to be sure, but in addition to these
he must, in order to get a correct conception, go out
into the mountains, into the rural districts, and
there study the soil, climate and products of the
country. He must commune with the yeomanry
the common people, and closely scrutinize their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
daily life and habits. He must see, as best he
can, how climate, political surroundings, education,
occupation, and religion affect their character.
He must project himself as far as possible into
the thoughts and feelings of the people among
whom he is traveling. This prepares him to
sympathize with them, and to look at things from
their standpoint. The traveler is then prepared
to reason from cause to effect. He has gotten
hold of that golden thread of truth which leads to
right conclusions. He is in condition to explain
upon correct and philosophical principles the
Socialism of France, the Skepticism of Germany,
the Nihilism of Russia, and the Pauperism of
Turkey.</p>

<p>Having under the providence of God been
permitted to make an extensive and prolonged
trip through the East, I determined from the
outset to get out of the <i>beaten tracks of travel</i>. In
applying the above-named principles, I walked a
thousand miles through different European countries,
and rode six hundred miles and more in
the saddle through Bible lands. This necessarily
gave me a varied experience, and brought me
into close contact with every phase of nature
and human nature. At times every faculty of
mind and heart was stirred to its profoundest
depths. I was forced to think. And, lest these
thrilling thoughts should slip away from me, I
determined “to fasten them in words and chain
them in writing.” I agree with Gray that “a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
words fixed upon or near the spot are worth a
cartload of <i>recollection</i>.”</p>

<p>This accounts to some extent for the use of the
present tense in the book, and also for the colloquial
style in which it is written&mdash;it was composed
<i>on or near the spot</i>. True, since then it has
been carefully revised, re-written and enlarged;
but originally it was written “on the spot.” I
made these pages my trusted confidant. To them
I expressed my “every thought and floating
fancy,” and my words formed a true thermometer
to my soul. But now I release these pages from
all obligations of secrecy. They may tell it in
Gath, and withhold it not in Askelon. I propose
to take the public into my confidence. “In short,
never did ten shillings purchase so much friendship
since confidence went first to market, or
honesty was set up to sale.”</p>

<p>I have carefully excluded all <i>opiates</i> from these
pages. Brevity is the only claim I make to wit.
I have not attempted to exhaust the subjects
treated. My words are intended simply to strike
the reader’s thoughts which may interpret further.
“If you would be prudent, be brief,” says Southey,
“for ‘tis with words as with sunbeams, the more
they are condensed the deeper they burn.”</p>

<p>“Clarence P. Johnson” was my man “Friday,”
and from some of the jokes gotten off at his expense
the reader may conclude that he is a “man-eater,”
as was that other Friday of Robinson
Crusoe fame. But not so. This was his maiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
trip out of his native city. Such things happened
to him while traveling as would naturally occur
with any other youth under the same circumstances.
He is a young man of fine spirit and extraordinary
business capacity. He will some day
be known and felt in the commercial world.</p>

<p>It gives me peculiar pleasure to acknowledge
my indebtedness to Professor John R. Sampey,
D. D., for valuable assistance rendered while preparing
this book for the press.</p>

<p>I have made free use of a wide range of literature,
but trust that in each case due credit has
been given to the author. Many of the measurements
given were made by myself, others have
been taken from reliable sources.</p>

<p>While abroad, I made it a special point to
study the history and outlook of the Baptists in
each of the several countries through which I
traveled, and I have not failed to record the
result of my observations. But, in order to
have Baptist history correctly, authentically, and
impartially given, I have secured chapters from
eminent men on the Baptists of their several
countries.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">PREPARATIONS for the trip were completed
when the week ended. Sunday, with its
sweet privileges and solemn services, came
and went. Mother and I knelt and prayed together.
Rising to our feet, she looked up through
her tears and smilingly said, “Son, the Lord has
given me strength to bear the separation. ‘Go,
and ‘God be with you till we meet again.’”</p>

<p>Monday morning, as the hands on the dial plate
point to seven, Johnson and I seat ourselves in a
carriage which is drawn by a horse whose path is
steel, whose heart is fire, and whose speed is lightning.
This impatient steed stands champing his
bit, and when the word is given he starts on his
long journey. At one bound he leaps the majestic
river, and on, on he rushes as if he fears eternity
will come before he reaches his journey’s end.
After traveling only a few hours, we run into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
blinding snow-storm which reminds us that Winter
still wields his icy sceptre, and rules with despotic
sway. This storm continues for hours; in truth, it
lasts until apparently the whole earth is wrapped
in a mantle of white, and until the majestic mountains
of Pennsylvania seem to rise up in their virgin
purity to kiss the vaulted sky.</p>

<p>Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, as
seen in their white robes, are more beautiful than
ever. Winter’s frosty breath has not chilled
their blood. They are filled with energy and
throbbing with life. From Philadelphia to New
York, there is almost one continuous string of cars
on each track. Along here our fiery steed sometimes
runs sixty miles an hour.</p>

<p>Long before we reach the metropolis, the shadows
of the sombre evening have shut out the light
of day. As we enter this great city, it looks as if
a thousand times ten thousand lamps are all trimmed
and burning. New York is a marvelous city.</p>

<p>As much time as I have spent here, I never cease
to wonder at it. Who could walk these streets
without wondering at the miles of granite buildings,
all joining each other and towering up from seven
to twelve and fourteen stories high; at the broad
sidewalks crowded from six o’clock in the morning
until ten at night with one ceaseless stream of humanity;
at the people rushing along at a breakneck
speed, as if they were going to great fires in
different parts of the city.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the double-tracked elevated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
railway and the double-tracked horse-cars, New
York can not furnish transportation for the people.
She will, I think, soon be compelled to
arrange for an underground railway&mdash;this is a
necessity. New York is the business heart of the
New World. Every American loves it. It is
his pride at home, his boast abroad.</p>

<p>At Temple Court I receive my mail, and meet
my friend, Dr. H. L. Morehouse, corresponding
secretary of the Baptist Home Missionary Society.
As usual, his face is bright and his greeting
cordial. He is planning great things for God,
and expecting great things of God. Few men
have done more to honor God and build up the
Baptist cause in America than Henry L. Morehouse.</p>

<p>A pleasant hour is spent with Dr. Norvin
Green, President of the Western Union Telegraph
Company. His reminiscences of European
travel are rehearsed. He says that in London
one can buy more for a shilling and less for a
pound than in any other place on earth. President
Green gives me a letter to his European
representative, and kindly extends other courtesies
that are duly appreciated.</p>

<p>After attending to banking business and securing
our ocean passage, we decide to run over to
New Haven and spend a few days with some special
friends. The double railroad track between
New York and New Haven is constantly in use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
When about half way between the two cities, our
engineer spies a handsomely dressed gentleman
walking on the other track, and going in the same
direction that we are going. A train is coming
facing the gentleman. Unconscious of the presence
of more than one train, he steps from one
track to the other, just in front of our engine.
Seeing the danger, both engineers try to stop
their trains, but do not succeed. Both blow their
whistles at the same time, but the walker, thinking
all the noise is made by one train, pays no attention.
Crash! Our engine strikes the man, and
throws him twenty feet from the track. The
trains stop. The passengers gather around the
unfortunate man. The blood is oozing from his
ears and nostrils. I take his head on my shoulder
and raise him up to get air. He struggles&mdash;gasps
for breath&mdash;and all is over. A letter in his
pocket indicates his name and residence.</p>

<p>A carriage is waiting for us at New Haven.
On reaching there, we are driven at once to the
happy home of Mr. W. G. Shepard, who forthwith
presents me to Master Walter Whittle Shepard.
This important character is only twelve months
old, but is full of life and promise. If he combines
the sweet spirit and graceful manners of his
mother with the strong character and bright intellect
of his father, I believe he will make a great
and useful man notwithstanding the fact that he
bears the author’s name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>New Haven, with her one hundred thousand
souls and great manufacturing interests, with her
parks and colleges, with her broad streets and
lordly elms, is one of the prettiest cities on the
American continent.</p>

<p>When we retired last night, the snow was falling
thick and fast; but we awoke this morning to
find that God had snatched a beautiful Sabbath
day from the bosom of the storm.</p>

<p>Mark Twain is in New Haven. In the course
of a lecture delivered here, he said: “A certain
college student got the words theological and
zoological confused&mdash;he did not know one from
the other. In talking to a friend, this collegian
said: ‘There are a great many donkeys in the
Theological Garden.’”</p>

<p>My stay in New Haven has been as pleasant
as a midsummer dream, and seemingly as short
as a widower’s courtship. But we must now return
to New York. In less than three hours we
will leave by the State Line, on “The State of
Indiana,” for Glasgow, Scotland. And now that
the time of my departure has come, I find myself
breathing a prayer to God, asking that He
will direct my course; that He will guide my
footsteps; that in all my wanderings He will keep
me from danger and death; that He will finally
bring me back in health and safety to the land of
my birth, to the friends of my childhood, to those
whom I love and who are dearer to me than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
life itself. And so may it be. More heartily
than ever before, I can say:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“My native country! thee,<br />
Land of the noble free,</p>
<p class="pp7">Thy name I love:</p>
<p class="pp6">I love thy rocks and rills,<br />
Thy woods and templed hills;<br />
My heart with rapture thrills</p>
<p class="pp7">Like that above.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">STEPPING on board the steamship State of
Indiana, I say to the purser: “Sir, I am from
the West; I want elbow-room. Can’t you
take away these partitions and turn several of
these compartments into one?” He replies: “You
are <i>now</i> from the West, but you will soon be <i>from</i>
this ship, unless you keep quiet.” From this remark
I see at once that the fellow is a crank, and
I will either let him have his own way or give him
a whipping. I choose the former; so we shake
hands over the bloody chasm&mdash;or, I should say,
over the briny deep.</p>

<p>I can never forget the scene that takes place at
the wharf. The hour for departure has arrived.
Hundreds of people have gathered around the vessel.
As the last bell rings, there is hurrying to
and fro. Friend leaving friend; husband kissing
wife; fathers and daughters, mothers and sons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
mingling their tears together, as parents and children
take their last fond embrace of each other.
Ah! There are streaming eyes and heavy hearts.
As the vessel moves off, one sees the throwing of
kisses, the waving of hats and handkerchiefs. But
we are gone. Tear-bedimmed eyes can no longer
behold the forms of loved ones. I dare say that
many of these partings will be renewed no more
on this earth.</p>

<p>One hazards very little in committing himself
to the winds and waves of the Atlantic when he is
on a goodly vessel, wisely planned and skillfully
put together; when the sea-captain is faithful and
experienced, and understands the workings of the
mariner’s compass and the position of the polar
star. But my very soul is stirred within me when
I think of the thousands and tens of thousands who
are sailing on life’s dark and tempestuous ocean
without a chart or compass; without a rudder to
steer or a hand to direct them; without the light
from the Star of Bethlehem to guide them over
the trackless waters to the Haven of Rest. They
came from nowhere! They see nothing ahead of
them save the rock-bound coast of eternity, beset
with false lights which are luring them on to the
breakers of death and the whirlpool of despair.
From the bottom of my heart do I thank God for
the “Old Ship of Zion,” planned by Divine Wisdom,
freighted with immortal souls, guided by the
Star of Hope, commanded by Jesus Christ, bound
for the Port of Glory!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>As we leave New York, the Bartholdi Statue
on Bedloe’s Island is one of the last things we
behold. This statue has been justly called “the
wonder of the century,” and one feels a national
pride in the thought that this statue, rising three
hundred feet in the air, her right hand lifting her
torch on high&mdash;that this statue, the wonder of the
age, is a fit emblem of the country to which it
belongs&mdash;<i>it is Liberty enlightening the world</i>!</p>

<p>I can not pause here to speak of the deep,
strange and strong impulses that stir one’s soul as
he sees his native land fade from view. I must,
instead, proceed to tell the reader something
about</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“A Life on the ocean wave,</p>
<p class="pp7">A home on the rolling deep,</p>
<p class="pp6">Where the scattered waters rave</p>
<p class="pp7">And the winds their revels keep.”</p>

<p class="p1">The first few days, if the sea is calm and quiet,
and so it is with us, are spent in forming new acquaintances.
No one wants an introduction to
any one. Everybody is supposed to know everybody
else. A hearty hand-shake, a friendly look
of the eye, and you are friends for the journey.
And I dare say that many who here meet will be
firm friends for the journey of life. The company
on board the ship is a little world within itself,
representing almost every phase of human life,
from the lowest to the highest. Here a statesman,
there a philosopher; here a musician, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
an artist. We have one wonderful fellow on
board, who is here, there, and everywhere. He is
anything, everything and nothing. He evidently
has more life in his heels than brains in his head,
and more folly on his tongue than reverence in
his heart&mdash;a pretended musician, who has decidedly
a better voice for eating soup than for singing
songs. And it comes to pass that a certain
small boy follows the example of this clown, and
the two together make things lively and thoroughly
uncomfortable for the rest of the party.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, after these acquaintances are
formed, birds of a feather flock together. The
Rev. Dr. Malcom MacVicar, Chancellor of the
MacMaster University of Toronto, and his highly
cultivated lady, are among our fellow-passengers.
I first met the Doctor some years ago, when in
Canada. He is an author of considerable note.
For twenty-five years previous to his going to
Canada, he was probably the most conspicuous
figure in the educational circles of New York
State. The University over which he is now
called to preside is a Baptist institution with a
million dollars endowment. Although raised to
high position and crowned with honors, Doctor
MacVicar is as humble and unassuming as though
he were in the lowliest walks of life. Prof. Honey,
of Yale University, places his wife under my care.
Mrs. Honey is a lady of lovely character and
superior attainments. Those whom I have mentioned,
together with two physicians from Indiana,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and Rev. Mr. Smith from Canada, form a little
party somewhat to ourselves, though we try not
to appear clannish.</p>

<p>The passengers are occasionally attracted by
whales, and are much interested in watching them.
Frequently two or three may be seen following
the vessel for miles and miles at a time, to get
such food as may be thrown overboard. Then
they strike out ahead of us, or to one side, chasing
each other through the water. These monsters
of the deep remind me of a former class-mate,
who was noted more for genial nature than for
strong intellect. One day, while the class in
chemistry were reciting, he said:</p>

<p>“Professor, I understand that fish is good brain-food.
Is it true?”</p>

<p>The teacher replied: “Yes, I am disposed to
think there is some truth in the statement.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to know that, Professor, I am going
to try it. How much do you think I ought
to eat?”</p>

<p>“Well, Sir,” responded the sarcastic professor,
“I should recommend at least half a dozen
whales.”</p>

<p>I am sure, however, that when I last saw the
student in question he had not begun the eating
of fish.</p>

<p>The fourth day is stormy and the sea rough.
The women and children are sick, very sick. The
men are thoroughly prepared to sympathize with
them. They all lose their sea-legs. The vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
is turned into a hospital. It is really amusing to
hear the different expressions from these afflicted
sons of Adam.</p>

<p>One fellow, amid his heaving and straining,
says: “I am not ‘zac’-ly sea-sick, but my stomach
hurts me mightily.”</p>

<p>Another, in like condition, says: “If they would
stop the ship only five minutes I would be all
right.”</p>

<p>In the midst of the severest agony, an old gentleman
ejaculates something like this: “I left my
children and loved ones at home, and I expect to
return in four months; but I would stay in
Europe four years, if I knew there would be a
railroad built across in that time.”</p>

<p>I did not hear this myself, but it is said of one
clergyman on board that amid the fierceness of
the storm he became exceedingly uneasy. Wringing
his hands, and approaching the chief officer,
he exclaimed: “O Captain, Captain, is there any
danger of d-e-a-t-h?” The captain replied: “Would
that I could give you some encouragement; but,
my Reverend Sir, in five minutes we shall all be in
Heaven.” At this, the distressed preacher clasped
his hands and cried aloud, “God forbid!” A
United States Minister on board said that any
one who would cross the ocean for pleasure,
would go to hell for amusement.</p>

<p>For five days the sea rages, and the vessel rolls
and labors and groans. Looking out over the
waters, I see ten thousand hills and mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
each crowned with white surf, which in the distance
looks like melting snow. Between these
mountains there are deep gorges and broad valleys.
A moment later the mountains and valleys
exchange places. Now on the crest of a wave,
the vessel is borne high in the air, and now she
drops into a yawning gulf below, coming down
first on one side then on the other. Now and
then she pitches head-foremost, reeling and staggering
like a drunken man.</p>

<p>But, as usual, calm and quiet follow the storm.
The sea is now as placid as a lake. The sun is
going down, apparently to bathe himself in a sea
of glory. In a few minutes the gleaming stars
will look down to see their bright faces reflected
in the water. The sick are restored to health,
the staggering walk is gone, and “Richard is
himself again.”</p>

<p>We were in sight of land almost the whole of
yesterday. About twilight last evening, we viewed
the western coast of “bonnie Scotland.” I
arose at an early hour this morning, to find our
stately craft smoothly gliding on the placid waters
of the river Clyde. It is a picture worthy of the
artist’s brush&mdash;a scene well calculated to inspire
every emotion of the poet’s soul.</p>

<p>On the north side of the majestic river, there is
a sodded plain, broad and unbroken, gradually rising
from the water’s edge. As we view this wooded
landscape o’er, we see, here and there, farmhouses,
which are as picturesque and beautiful as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
they are quaint and old, with the smoke from
their ivy-covered chimneys coiling up and ascending
on high like incense from the altar of burnt
offering. Turning our eyes southward, we behold,
hard by the stream, a long chain of towering
mountains, whose gently sloping sides are carpeted
with green grass, and girt around with budding
trees. The heavy rain-drops on the grass and
leaves are sparkling in the light of the new-risen
sun. The mountains are echoing the merry tune
which comes from the whistling plowman on the
opposite shore. Now, between these two prospects,
on the broad and unruffled bosom of this
flowing river, our heavily-laden vessel, as though
she were weary because of her long journey,
moves slowly, gracefully, noiselessly, with the stars
and the stripes proudly streaming from her mast-head.
Indeed so motionless and queenly is our
goodly vessel in her onward course, that she is
apparently standing still while the mountains and
plains are passing in review before her.</p>

<p>A little farther up the stream, we see Dumbarton
Castle standing in the river. This historic
rock measures a mile in circumference, and rises
three hundred feet above the water. This castle
was at one time the prison of Sir William Wallace,
and afterwards the stronghold of Robert
Bruce. From here on to Glasgow the Clyde is
lined on both sides with iron-foundries and ship-building
yards.</p>

<p>The voyage ends at Glasgow. The passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
are glad once more to press <i>terra firma</i> under
their feet. I would write something about Glasgow,
but I am like the more hopeful one of two
Irishmen who went to America. Landing in New
York, they started up town. They had gone
only a few paces, when one of them saw a ten
dollar gold piece lying on the sidewalk, and
stooped to pick it up. The other said: “Oh,
don’t bother to get that little coin; we will foind
plenty of pieces larger than that.”</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi08">I AROSE this morning at an early hour, and,
after partaking of a hearty breakfast, I at once
repair to the Grand Central Depot in Glasgow
where, a few minutes later, I seat myself in
an English railway car. These cars are, of course,
made on the same general plan as ours, yet they
are in some respects quite different. The coaches
are of about the same length as those used in
America, but not so wide by eighteen inches
or two feet. Each coach is divided into five
compartments, each being five and one-half or
six feet long. Each of these compartments has
two doors, one on either side of the car, also two
seats. Persons occupying these different seats
must face each other, so one party or the other
must ride backwards. They have no water or
other conveniences on the train, as we Americans
are accustomed to; no bell-rope to pull, in
case of accident; no baggage-checks&mdash;each passenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
must look after his own baggage. As for
myself, I have no baggage, save what I can carry
in the car with me. They have first, second, and
third-class compartments, the fare per mile being
four, three, and two cents respectively. I have examined
closely, and can not detect one particle of
difference between the first and second-class compartments,
either one being fully as good as our
first-class car. The English first and second-class
compartments are slightly superior to the third-class.
It is a saying among the Europeans that
only millionaires, soreheads (crowned heads), and
fools ride first-class. Being neither a millionaire
nor a crowned head, and, as I am unwilling to be
classed as a fool, I always take third-class passage.</p>

<p>I believe in talking, asking questions, and
exchanging ideas with every man I meet, be he
high or low, rich or poor. So, while standing at
the depot this morning, amid a great crowd of
people, looking at the engines, I remark to a
pleasant-looking conductor standing near me, that
there is quite a difference in the engines used in
this country and those used in America. He
wants to know what that difference is. I tell him
that our engines have cow-catchers before them
and his has none. “A cow-catcher,” says he,
“and what is that?” I explain to him that a cow-catcher
is an arrangement fastened on in front of
the engines to remove obstructions from the
road, to knock cows from the track, etc. “Ah,
indeed! We never need those in this country,
and can you tell me,” he continues, “why we do
not need them?” “Well, sir,” I reply, “I can see
only one reason.” “And what is that, pray?” I
answer, “It must be, sir, that you do not run fast
enough to overtake a cow.” This creates quite a
laugh at the conductors expense, though none
seems to enjoy it more heartily than he. Just at
this moment, the train starts, and I am off for
Ayr, some forty miles away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>As I step from the train in Ayr, the hack-drivers
gather around me like bees around the “Last
Rose of Summer.” “Carriage, carriage, sir?” they
cry. “I’ll be glad to show you through the city,
and take you to Burns’ Monument&mdash;carriage,
carriage?” Tipping my hat, I reply, “No, gentlemen,
I will take a carriage some other time, when
I have more leisure. I prefer walking to-day, as
I am in a great hurry.” So, each with a cane in
his hand and a portmanteau strapped on his back,
Johnson, my pleasant traveling companion, and I
set out on foot for “The Land of Burns.”</p>

<p>Luckily, we meet with some intelligent farmers
who cheerfully give us much valuable information
about the country. They, in turn, ask many
questions concerning far-off America. Land in
this part of Scotland is worth from two hundred
to three hundred dollars per acre, and the annual
rent is twenty to twenty-five dollars per acre.
Most of the land in this country is owned by a few
“lords” and “nobles,” and the “common people”
are in bondage to them. They are in poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and rags, as might naturally be expected from
the exorbitant rents which they have to pay.</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Man’s inhumanity to man,</p>
<p class="pp7">Makes countless millions mourn.”</p>

<p class="p1">The principal crops raised by the farmers of
this country are wheat, oats, rye, barley and Irish
potatoes. They grow no Indian corn. They do
not know what corn-bread is&mdash;many of them
have never heard of it.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">BURNS’ COTTAGE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>After a walk of an hour and a half through a
most charming country, we reach our destination.
I am now sitting in the room where was born
Robert Burns who, Dr. Whitsitt says, was the
most important personage that the British Isles
have produced since the time of Oliver Twist&mdash;oh,
excuse me, I should have said, since the time
of Oliver Cromwell. I would have had it right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
at first, if that “twist” had not gotten into my
mind. This important personage was born 128
years ago. How long this cottage was standing
before that time, we do not know; but, as you
may imagine, it is now a rude and antique structure.
It is built of stone, and the walls are about
six feet high. It has an old-fashioned straw or
thatched roof and a stone floor. A hundred
years ago, this room had only one window. That
is only eighteen inches square, and is on the back
side of the house. In the time of Burns, the
cottage had only two rooms, though some additions
have since been made. The entire place
is now owned by the “Ayr Burns’ Monument Association,”
and the original rooms are used only
as a museum, wherein are collected the furniture,
books, manuscripts and other relics of the illustrious
bard.</p>

<p>I have, for a long time, been somewhat familiar
with the history and writings of the “Peasant
Poet,” whose birthplace I now visit, and I have
often read Carlyle’s caustic essay on Burns. I
have just finished reading his life, written by
James Currie. I have read, to-day, “The Holy
Fair,” “Tam O’Shanter,” “Man Was Made to
Mourn,” and “To Mary, in Heaven,” and now, as
I sit in the room where this High Priest of Nature
first saw light, as I sit at the table whereon he
used to write, and view the relics which once belonged
to him, I am carried back for a hundred
years and made to breathe the atmosphere of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
eighteenth century. As I sit within these silent
walls, a strange feeling comes over me. I hear, or
seem to hear, the lingering vibrations of that golden
lyre, whose master indeed is dead, but whose
music still finds a responsive echo in every human
heart. Robert Burns, the man, was born of a
woman but Robert Burns, the poet, was born of
Nature! He stole the thoughts of Nature and
told them to man. It was believed long ago that
Burns was the High Priest, the interpreter, of
Nature, and</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Time but the impression deeper makes,<br />
As streams their channels deeper wear.”</p>

<p class="pn1">The multitudes who hither come, prove by their
coming that</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Such graves as his are pilgrim shrines,<br />
Shrines to code nor creed confined&mdash;<br />
The Delphic vales, the Palestines&mdash;<br />
The Meccas of the mind.”</p>

<p class="p1">Some three hundred yards beyond the cottage,
we come to the “Burns’ Monument,” beautifully
situated on “The braes and banks o’bonnie Doon,
Tugar’s winding stream.” A more appropriate
location could not have been selected for this
monument, as near by are the “Alloway Kirk,”
the “Wallace Tower,” the “Auld Mill,” and the
“Auld Hermit Ayr,” and other localities rendered
famous by the muse of the ploughman poet. I
stand on the “Brig o’ Doon” before reaching the
keystone of which Meg, Tam O’Shanter’s mare,
“left behind her ain grey tail.”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>From the top of this towering monument, which
stands in the midst of a beautiful flower-garden, I
for once take a “broad view of life.” With one
sweep of the eye, I see the Doon, the Ayr, the
Clyde, the ocean! The scene is made more grand
and inspiring, more picturesque and beautiful, by
the lakes, plains, hills and mountains which lie
between, overhang, and tower above, these laughing
rivers. Ah! me, how my spirit is stirred!
Like Father Ryan, I have thoughts too lofty for
language to reach. In describing what I now see
and feel, silence is the most impressive language
that can be used. Thought is deeper than speech.
Feeling is deeper than thought.</p>

<p class="drop-capi15">WE ARE now in Edinburgh; we have been
here some days. On our way from Ayr,
we fell in with a jolly party of American
gentlemen. The eyes of one grey-haired brother
in the crowd are somewhat dimmed with age,
though he is unwilling to acknowledge it.</p>

<p>As the train made a graceful curve around a
mountain, we came into a large, green pasture
where many sheep were grazing. Now, the people
of this country feed their sheep on turnips&mdash;large,
yellow turnips, with the tops cut off. While
in this pasture, we saw, some seventy-five or a
hundred yards from the road, a great quantity of
these turnips scattered over the grass for sheep
food. The dim-eyed pilgrim spied the yellow objects
and, pointing to them, he enthusiastically exclaimed:
“Oh, what a fine lot of young goslings!”
Then he added, “There are the goslings, but
where are the geese?” I explained that those
objects he saw were not “goslings” but turnips,
and suggested that the goose was on our train.
Before we separated, the two parties became fast
friends. We all agreed to throw in and buy our
friend a farm, to be known, not as a turnip patch,
but as “The American Goose Ranch,” and on
this ranch we are to meet the first day of May of
each year, to discuss vital questions and living
issues pertaining to the life and character of
“young goslings.”</p>

<p>Leaving the pasture, we passed the Moorhouse
farm, where Robert Pollok, author of “The Course
of Time,” was born, in 1798, two years after the
death of Robert Burns. We came by Linlithgow,
the birthplace of Queen Mary. The majestic
ruins of its once proud palace are still standing
on a green hillside near the town, as if to impress
the passer-by with the mutability of all human
greatness and all human grandeur.</p>

<p>In one hour more we had reached the end of
our journey. Edinburgh has two hundred and
fifty thousand inhabitants, just half the number of
Glasgow, and is a magnificent city. It is the pride
of every Scotchman. It is called “The Classic
City,” “The Bonnie City,” “The Capital City,”
“The Monumental City,” and “The Athens of
Britain.” I expected to hear it called “The
Boston of Europe,” but the people did not seem
to think of it. This was the birthplace of Sir
Walter Scott, the novelist and poet; the home of
Hume, the scholar and historian; of John Knox,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the reformer, who never feared the face of man,
nor doubted the Word of God; of Thomas Chalmers,
the Astronomical preacher from whose pulpit
the stars poured forth a flood of light and
glory; and it was for a thousand years the home
of the Scottish Kings and state officials. It is
now the political home of Gladstone, who is perhaps
the greatest living statesman, and the home
of Drummond, author of “Natural law in the
Spiritual World.”</p>

<p>The city is filled with many objects of peculiar
interest, only a few of which I will mention.
About a hundred years ago, though the people
here speak of it as “recently,” the city was greatly
enlarged, and I suppose the object of the enlargement
was to make room for the monuments and
statues. One sees a monument on almost every
street-corner, and there is a perfect forest of
statuary. These Scotch people are very fond of
honoring great men. I am going to leave here
to-morrow, for fear they put up a monument to
me. They have not said anything about the
monument yet, but I notice the police have been
following me about for two or three days, as
though they thought of something of that sort.</p>

     <div class="cf"><p class="pc">SCOTT’S MONUMENT.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On Princess street, in the prettiest and most
romantic part of the city, stands a colossal monument
to Sir Walter Scott which was fashioned by
one of the world’s greatest artists, and which is
said to be one of the most superb structures of
the kind ever built. I am quite prepared to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the statement. In this monument architectural
grandeur and artistic
beauty are blended in the
sweetest and most perfect
manner imaginable. Like
a sunset at sea, it never
becomes monotonous,
but is always pleasing.
A fit emblem
this of Scott
himself, in whom
a strong character
was so
gracefully blended
with smooth
and polished
manners. This
monument may
be painted, but
it beggars description.</p>

<p>To me, however,
the most
interesting object
in Edinburgh
is the
Castle, located
just in the centre
of the city. The
Castle is built on a high rock whose base covers
an area of eleven acres. This rock rises to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
height of four hundred feet, its summit being
accessible only in one place, the other portions
of the rock being very precipitous, and, in some
places, absolutely perpendicular. The top of the
rock presents a level surface, has an area of five
acres, and is surmounted by a massive stone wall
built close around on the edge of the cliff. On
this storm-beaten rock, and within these moss-covered
walls, stands the historical Castle, built ten
centuries ago. In appearance the Castle is “grand,
gloomy, and peculiar.” In his charming poem, Marmion,
Scott refers to it thus:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Such dusky grandeur clothed the night,</p>
<p class="pp7">Where the huge castle holds its state,</p>
<p class="pp6">And all the steep slope down;</p>
<p class="pp8">Whose ridgy back heaves to the sky,<br />
Piled deep and massive, close and high,</p>
<p class="pp7">Mine own romantic town!”</p>

<p class="p1">According to the history of Scotland, which to
me is as charming as a story of romance, this
Castle has a strange and bloody tale to tell.
Here James II was confined, likewise James III.
Here “The Black Dinner” was given, and the
Douglasses were murdered. Here the Duke of
Argyle and the good Montrose were beheaded.
Montrose, you remember, is a conspicuous figure
in Scottish history. He was loyal to his king and
country. He was courageous as a lion, and as
true and noble as he was brave. Yet he was
tried before a false court, whose verdict was that
on the next day he should be put to death, and
his head placed on the prison wall. When permitted
to reply, Montrose, in his calm and dignified
manner, stepped forward and, with his usual
boldness, said to the Parliament: “Sirs, you heap
more honor upon me in having my head placed
upon the walls of this Castle, for the cause in
which I die, than if you had this day decreed
to me a golden statue, or had ordered my picture
placed in the King’s bed-chamber.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1650, Cromwell besieged the Castle, for
more than two months, without success. This
was the home of the beautiful Queen Mary at the
time she gave birth to James VI, since whose
reign the whole of Great Britain has been ruled
by one sceptre.</p>

<p>In what is called “The Crown Room” of the
Castle, are “The Stones of Power,” or the “Emblems
of Scottish Royalty.” These regalia consist
of three articles, the Crown, the Sceptre, and
the Sword of State. By a fortunate circumstance,
I obtain free access to these royal relics. They
are entirely new to me, hence I examine them
closely. Thinking perhaps the reader would like
to know something of an earthly crown before
going home to wear an Heavenly one, I give the
following description of this one: The lower part
is composed of two circles, the undermost much
broader than that which rises above it. Both are
made of purest gold. The under and broader
circle is adorned with twenty-two precious stones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
such as diamonds, rubies, topazes, amethysts,
emeralds and sapphires. There is an Oriental
pearl interposed between each of these stones.
The smaller circle, which surmounts the larger
one, is studded with small diamonds and sapphires
alternately. From this upper circle two
imperial arches rise, crossing each other at right
angles, and closing at the top in a pinnacle of
burnished gold.</p>

<p>The Sceptre is a slender and an elegant rod of
silver, three feet long, gilded with gold and set
with diamonds. The Sword of State is five feet
long. The scabbard is made of crimson velvet
and is ornamented with beautiful needlework and
silver.</p>

<p>In the same glass case with the above-named
insignia, is a golden collar of the “Order of the
Garter,” which collar is said to be that presented
by Queen Elizabeth to King James VI when he
was created Knight of that Order. In the same
case, is also a ruby ring labeled as the coronation
ring of Charles I. But enough about</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“The steep and belted rock,</p>
<p class="pp6">Where trusted lie the monarchy’s last gems&mdash;<br />
The Sceptre, Sword, and Crown that graced the brows,<br />
Since Father Fungus, of an hundred kings.”</p>

<p class="p1">I am having a perfect feast in re-reading the
“Heart of Midlothian,” the plot of which is laid in
this city. I never had such a thirst for knowledge,
nor did I ever enjoy reading so much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
now. I make daily visits to the Haymarket, to
the old Tolbooth, to Holyrood Palace, to Arthur’s
Seat, to the cottage where the Dean family lived,
and to many places which have been baptized in
blood, and about which Scott’s muse loved to sing.</p>

<p>While in the Waverly Hotel, a few days ago,
I chanced to meet Reverends J. K. Pace and W.
T. Hundly, Baptist preachers from South Carolina.
What a happy meeting! We were together
only two days. Theirs was a flying trip, and they
had to rush on to London and the Continent
without seeing much of “Bonnie Scotland.” We
agree to meet in six weeks in London or Paris.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">AFTER a sojourn of ten days, I left Edinburgh,
the site of Scottish nobility. While there
I heard so much of Dukes and Earls, of
Lords and Nobles, of Her Majesty and His Royal
Highness, etc., that it became necessary for me to
seek some mountain peak where I could get a full
supply of fresh air. If there is such a thing, I
have a pious contempt for high-sounding titles
of honor and nobility, and especially when, as is
too often the case, the appellations themselves
are of more consequence than the men who wear
them. A man may indeed have a <i>great name</i>
“thrust upon him,” but <i>greatness itself</i> is not thus
attained. I like to see a son inherit his father’s
good qualities, and the more of them the better,
but as for honors and titles, let him win those for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
himself. I saw a “Duke” the other day who
reminded me of a half-grown boy on the streets
wearing his father’s worn-out pants and coat and
hat.</p>

<p>Well, as I started out to say, I became so
nauseated with these inherited, worn-out, loose-fitting
titles of nobility that I determined to leave
the rendezvous of “honor,” and get out into the
country among the common people. Accordingly
I left Edinburgh, a week ago to-day, for an
extended tramp-trip through the Highlands. I
came first by rail, via Glasgow, to Dunbarton, a
ship-building town of 13,000 inhabitants, on the
river Clyde. Thence, a pleasant walk of three
miles brought me to Dunbarton Castle, which I
saw from the steamer as we were coming from
America, and which was barely mentioned in a
previous chapter. “This Castle,” says the Scottish
historian, “is one of the strongest in Europe,
if not in the world.” It is, as before stated, a
great moss-covered rock, standing in the river,
measuring a mile in circumference, and rising
nearly three hundred feet high. In the first
century of the Christian era, the Romans gained
possession of, and fortified themselves in, this
Castle. By the treachery of John Monmouth,
Sir William Wallace, while on this rock, was
betrayed, in 1305, into the hands of the British,
who took him to London and struck off his head,
after which his body was quartered and exposed
upon spikes of iron on London Bridge. A long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
two-handed sword, once used by Wallace, and
other ancient relics of warfare, are shown to the
visitor.</p>

<p>From the top of the Castle, one gets a commanding
view of the surrounding country. While
there, looking northward, I saw Ben Lomond,
more than twenty miles away. I could not refrain
from taking off my hat to this “Mountain
Monarch.” And, as if to return my salute, the
clouds just then were lifted, leaving the snow-covered
head of the mountain bare for a moment.
For this act of civility, I determined to pay His
Royal Highness a visit. Hence, with felt hats
pulled down over our eyes, with canes in hand,
and small leather satchels strapped across our
backs, my traveling companion and I set out on
foot for the Highlands.</p>

<p>We followed no road, being guided by the
river only, which flows from Loch Lomond into
the Clyde. The general scenery along this route
is nothing unusual; but the river itself is surpassingly
beautiful, its water being transparent, and
flowing deep, smooth and swift, but silent, between
its level green banks.</p>

<p>Just before entering a small town, on the river,
called Renton, we met hundreds of girls and young
women homeward bound, all wearing sleeveless
dresses, and carrying tin buckets. Their dyed
hands and arms bespoke their occupation. They
were factory girls, employed in the paint works
the largest in Scotland. In this town, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
splendid obelisk to Tobias Smollet, the novelist
and poet, who was born here in 1721.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock we reached a wayside inn,
where a few shillings secured us comfortable accommodations.
Next morning was dark and
cloudy. A few hours’ walk found us at the head
of Loch Lomond, where we took shipping on the
neat little steamer, “Prince Consort.” We had
several tourists, artists, poets, musicians, and other
persons of taste and culture, on board, all of
whom, like ourselves, had come to see and enjoy
“Bonnie Scotland.” But the clouds were so dark
and low, the mist so dense and heavy, that we
could see little or nothing of the beauty and
grandeur by which we were surrounded. Before
nightfall, though the whole day seemed almost
like night, “The Prince” touched at a landing
called Tarbet, where we disembarked and secured
lodging. The day was damp, cold and dark;
everything around us wore a gloomy aspect. We
were tired. We could see nothing to interest the
mind or delight the eye. So Morpheus soon
claimed us as his captives for the night. But, ere
those nocturnal hours passed away, God’s own
hand removed the clouds and curtains which,
the day before, hid the works of Nature from
our view.</p>

<p>Next morning, the sound of the clock striking
eight disturbed the “spirit of my dreams.” The
reader can better imagine, than I can describe, my
feelings when I arose and looked around me. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
found that it was a warm, bright, beautiful spring
morning, and that I was in the loveliest spot on
earth. I was in the midst of a large flower-garden,
laid out with great care and excellent
taste, containing a fine variety of shrubbery and
a rich profusion of delicate and fragrant flowers.
Behind me was a range of mountains, high and
lifted up, extending also to the right hand and to
the left, leaving the flower-garden just in a graceful
curve of the mountain chain. Before me, and
toward the east, was Loch Lomond, the Queen of
the Highland Lakes. Her waters were clear as
crystal, and her bosom was unruffled by a single
wave, there being just motion enough upon the
mirror-like surface to cause the sunbeams falling
upon the water to glisten like a sea of sparkling
diamonds.</p>

<p>Across the Loch, and just one mile away, was
Ben Lomond, the lordliest mountain in all Scotland&mdash;the
same that returned my salute from
Dunbarton Castle. While the foot of this majestic
mountain was washed by the waters of the
lake, its brow was wrapped in the snow of winter
and bathed in the clouds of heaven. Thus the
beautiful lake is surrounded by</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Mountains that like giants stand<br />
To sentinel the enchanted land.”</p>

<p class="pn1">And each towering crag and cliff and mountain
peak was seen reflected in the silver mirror lying
at their feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to all these attractions, that morning
when I awoke it seemed as if all the birds of
the country, with their merry voices and bright
plumage, had assembled to hold their spring carnival.
One of their number was unlike any of
the feathered tribe I had seen before. It had a
dove-colored breast; night and morning were
delicately interwoven in its wings, and it sang “as
if every tiny bone in its body were a golden
flute.” A good old lady living there told me that
when Dr. Thomas Chalmers stood where I was
standing that morning, and saw and heard what
then greeted my eyes and ears, he exclaimed: “I
wonder if there will be such scenery and music as
this in heaven!”</p>

<p>Ah! this is Scotland, “Bonnie Scotland,” whose
picturesque scenery has waked the harp of so
many bards, and has often set the artist’s eye “in
fine frenzy rolling.” I am not surprised that the
mantle of poesy fell upon Burns while following
the plow; my only wonder is that all Scotchmen
are not poets. In fact, when I awoke that morning
and found myself in that terrestrial heaven, I
did not know what was the matter with me.
There was a fluttering underneath my ribs. It
was a deep and strong, yet a pleasing and delightful
sensation. I thought it was a poet’s soul in
me! Rushing to the desk with hair uncombed, I
arranged my stationery, and sat with pen in hand
waiting for the light to break in upon me&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
spell passed off before I could get hold
of the first rhyme. What a pity!</p>

<p>After being here a short time, Johnson and I
decide to take a trip through the mountains and
visit Loch Long, a few miles west. We are not
at all disappointed when we arrive at the Loch.
The scenery is wild, savage, grand! Beyond the
lake, or loch, we see the Cobbler, a towering
mountain, covered with snow. The mountain is
apparently not far off, seemingly about two hours’
walk. Now this, the Cobbler, is not the highest
mountain in Scotland, but is said to be the hardest
one in the whole country to climb.</p>

<p>Not knowing the difficulty of our undertaking,
we determine to plant our feet in the snow glittering
upon the Cobbler’s crown. We are almost
exhausted when we reach the base, but, after
resting a few minutes, I say: “Johnson, renew
your strength, and let us go.” For awhile the
ascent is comparatively easy; but we soon come
to great walls of black rock, rough and steep,
some places being almost perpendicular. We try
to go around the worst places, determining, however,
that when we come to a rock which we can
not go around, we will go over it. This we
manage to do by the assistance of the grass and
twigs growing in the crevices of the rock, but the
climbing is exceedingly difficult and tiresome, and
often dangerous. One time in particular my escape
is narrow. I am standing on a narrow shelf
of rock. Below me is a yawning chasm, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sixty feet deep. Above is a wall almost straight
up and down, eighteen feet high. With dire apprehensions
I start up. When about two-thirds
of the way up, a bush, whose fastenings in the
crevice of the rock are not as strong as I thought,
gives way with me. Down I come on the narrow
rock-shelf, and almost into the chasm below. For
some minutes I am unable to move, though I am
worse frightened than injured. Johnson excitedly
calls out: “Whittle, Whittle, are you hurt?” I
reply, “No, I am like a cat&mdash;always catch on foot.
Besides, ‘A man’s greatness consists not in his
never falling, but in always rising after a fall.’”</p>

<p>The day before this memorable tramp, a heavy
rain had fallen and the grass, with which many
parts of the mountain are covered, is very wet,
hence our feet are soon as wet as water can make
them. Under these difficulties, we have not gotten
more than two-thirds of the way up the mountain,
before my companion, who, like a mountain
goat, loves to climb, gives out completely. He
has neither the strength to go to the top, nor the
spirit to start down. Rest is the only hope. So,
with two overcoats for a pallet, a round stone for
a pillow, and the blue sky for a covering, I put
Johnson to bed, and he is to sleep while I am to
continue my journey to the top of the mountain,
and hasten back with some snow for dinner.</p>

<p>The summit is more distant, and the way more
difficult and perilous, than we had supposed.
However, I have started to the top, and I am determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to go there, “if it takes all the summer.”
And I do. But in order to accomplish my purpose
I must go around and approach the long-sought
brow from the opposite side. I reach the
very top! And, although my trembling limbs are
so weak and weary that I can scarcely stand, yet
I feel fully repaid for all my toil. The snow
under my feet is five feet deep. About a half
mile beyond me is another mountain towering up
apparently a thousand feet above me, and covered
with snow from head to foot. It looks frightful;
and almost unwittingly I exclaim: “Niagara petrified!
A mountain of snow falling from the
clouds!” The sight is grand, but I can not prolong
my stay, for obvious reasons. I am wet with
perspiration, and, having left my overcoat with
Johnson, I am now suffering&mdash;the cold and cutting
wind pierces to the bone; and besides night
is coming on.</p>

<p>Now a new trouble begins. I can not find
Johnson. I do not know on which side of the
mountain I left him. I have no idea as to where
he is! But the worst of all is that Johnson, after
sleeping three hours, wakens, and, as I have not
returned, becomes uneasy about me. He supposes
that I have either gotten into the snow and can
not get out, or have fallen over some precipice
and hurt or killed myself. So he, out of the
goodness of his heart, sets out in search of me.
Each hunts for the other until night without
success. Fortunately, however, we agreed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
morning on a place to spend the night. On
reaching the place agreed upon, I find that he is
not there&mdash;nor has he been seen! While I am
making preparations to go back, with assistance,
to hunt for him the door flies open and in steps
Johnson, completely exhausted, and sick besides.
Thus ends our first day among the mountains!</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">SCOTLAND, as the reader knows, is a small
country. Its length from north to south is
two hundred miles, but east and west the
country is very narrow, no part of it being more
than forty miles from the sea-coast. This small
area is divided into what are known as the “Highlands”
and “Lowlands,” the two sections being as
unlike in the nature of the soil, the character of
the scenery, the habits and industries of the people,
as though they were a thousand miles apart.
To the historian and tourist the Highlands, occupying
the northern, or rather the northwestern,
portion of Scotland, is by far the most interesting
section. The term, Highlands, however, does not,
as many people think, designate a broad, level,
elevated table-land. On the contrary, the Highlands
of Scotland are a wild, savage world by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
themselves, composed entirely of hills, morasses,
mountains, glens, moors, lakes and rivers.</p>

<p>For the last fifteen days, I have been in the
heart of this enchanted land, locked, as it were, in
this rock-ribbed region. I have spent the time
in walking through the country; rowing on the
lochs, or lakes; climbing mountains; threading
glens; exploring caves; talking to the people of
high and low degree, thus gaining information of
every kind and character, both as to the past and
present condition of this wild country and its
poverty-stricken people. Hard work this. A
man walking through the mountains needs a good
sole (soul)&mdash;spell it as you please. To me,
however, the work (I can not call it by any other
name half so appropriate) has been as pleasant
as it has been difficult, and as profitable as both
combined. When I become very tired, and that
is no infrequent occurrence, I spread myself out
on the soft side of some projecting rock, high on
the mountain side, and there, while resting, I
alternately feast my eager eyes on the outstretching
landscape, or read from books which I have
along for that purpose. I read the “History of
Scotland,” “Heart of Midlothian,” “Rob Roy,”
“The Lady of the Lake,” “The Lay of the Last
Minstrel,” and “Marmion.” In this way I have
read much of the history, poetry, and fiction of
Scotland while on the spot, or in the immediate
neighborhood about which it was written. It
lends a new charm and gives an additional zest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to what one reads, when he can lift his eyes from
the book and behold the places and objects mentioned
in its glowing pages.</p>

<p>I can never forget my experience of a week ago
to-day. I was up at an early hour. The sky was
cloudless and the morn calm and quiet. Across
the lake stood Ben Lomond in its giant-like proportions.
Its brow, grey with eternal snow, looked
so inviting that I determined to ascend and sniff
the mountain breeze. A friend, where I spent
the night, and who knew the difficulties in the
way, tried to dissuade me from my purpose; but
when I take the bit between my teeth there is no
bridle that can stop me. Johnson, who by this
time had thoroughly recovered from his maiden
effort at climbing mountains, and who is as fleet
as a hart and spirited as a gazelle, agreed to
accompany me. So, ere the warbler had finished
his morning song, and while the dew was yet
sparkling bright on the heath, we set out for that
towering peak, “where snow and sunshine alone
have dared to tread.”</p>

<p>For sixpence, a farmer’s lad rowed us across
the loch, landing us at the foot of the mountain
whose rocky cliffs and thunder-riven sides we
were to climb. Seven hours’ toil brought us to
the objective point, and rewarded us with one of
the finest, wildest, and most romantic views to be
had anywhere this side that deep and yawning
gulf which separates time from eternity. I found
myself surrounded by a thousand peaks, crags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and cliffs, whose heads were white with the accumulated
snows of fifty winters, they being of different
heights, and of every conceivable shape, size
and angle&mdash;all having been caused, apparently, by
the upheaval of some mighty volcanic eruption of
the under world. These iron-belted mountain
sides are honey-combed with deep and dark dens,
dangerous pits and caves, which once furnished
shelter and security to those savage and lawless
clans whose sole occupation was arms, and who,
under cover of night, often swooped down upon
the barns, flocks and herds of the Lowlanders like
eagles upon their prey. When once hidden away
in those dark recesses, it would take an hundred-eyed
devil to discover their whereabouts; and, if
discovered, it would require an iron-handed Hercules
to rout and discomfit them.</p>

<p>Many of these peaks and cliffs are separated
only by narrow and gloomy glens hundreds of feet
deep. The glen may be ten, fifteen, or twenty-five
feet wide at the bottom, but the rough and irregular
sides tower up so high, and come so near
closing at the top, that the rocky chasm is dark
and gloomy. I have, I think, very little superstition
about me; yet I confess that while walking
through these silent halls, where the sun has never
shone, I felt half inclined to look around me for
hissing serpents, for hobgoblins and rats. While
in one of these unseemingly&mdash;I had almost said
unearthly&mdash;places, a dreamy, far-away spell came
over me. I fell into an absent-minded mood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Just as I reached a dark, horrible-looking place,
I paused. I stood still, my eyes resting upon the
stone floor; I was thinking about&mdash;I do not know
what. All at once I heard a furious noise; and,
turning suddenly around, I beheld a huge wildcat
rushing down the glen, with eyes glaring like
balls of fire. By this time he was within five feet
of me, and gave the most unearthly yell that I
have ever heard. It seemed as if it would rend
the very rocks. Every hair on my head was a
goose-quill, and they were all on ends. For a
moment I was still as death, and pulseless as
a statue, while the noise that startled me was
rolling, ringing, and reverberating down the glen
like the mutterings of distant thunder. As John
Bunyan would say, “I departed, and was seen,
there no more.”</p>

<p>Having gotten out of the glen, I went back
upon Ben Lomond and enjoyed the picture. I
said it was a grand sight, and so it was. Turn
my eyes as I would, I could see mountain streams
fed by melting snow, the water being churned into
madness as it leaped from rock to rock, until it
was lost in the abyss below. Looking beneath
me, I could see several of the Scottish lakes,
which were as beautiful as the mountains were
grand. I saw Loch Lomond, on whose calm
bosom many islands float, winding around like a
silver thread among the mountains for twenty
miles.</p>

<p>All this made a picture that I can never forget.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
It is indelibly stamped on the imperishable tablets
of memory; and there it will remain, an
object of interest and admiration, until the flood-gates
of life are shut in eternal rest.</p>

<p>We visited Rob Roy’s cave, the land of the
Macgregors, the house in which Helen Macgregor
was born, Loch Katrine where Scott wrote “The
Lady of the Lake,” and many other places known
to history and to song.</p>

<p>Johnson and I found no difficulty in walking
twelve to twenty miles a day. We sometimes
obtained lodgings with peasants, and at others
with “gentlemen,” or landlords. The peasants
call themselves “servants,” and always speak of
the landlord as “master.” This nomenclature is
suggestive of the real relationship existing between
the two classes. It is none other than that
of master and slave. These peasants are still
plodding along in the same old grooves whose
rough edges wore their fathers out. Many of
them, like the dumb ass in the tread-mill, expect
only their bread, and verily they are not disappointed.
I almost wonder that the very stones
in the streets do not rise in mutiny, and clamor
for justice until their cry is heard by the dull ears
of power.</p>

<p>While walking from Loch Lomond to Loch
Katrine, I saw several peasants spading up the
ground. They had dug several holes, each large
enough to swallow a good-sized house. The dirt
was taken out in square blocks, much the size of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
three bricks put side by side, or about the shape
of a Mexican adobe. In appearance, these blocks
resembled soft, sticky, black prairie mud. Seeing
them spread out to dry, I thought they were to
be used as building material. Upon making inquiry,
I found that it (the dirt) was preparing for
fuel. The peasants call it moss. They dry
it and stack it, as we stack fodder or oats. They
say it burns well.</p>

<p>The Scotch people, as a whole, have impressed
me very favorably. They have a straightforward
way of doing business. Almost every face wears
on it the stamp of genuine honesty. The better
classes of people are social, kind and accommodating
in their nature, though somewhat stiff and
dignified in their bearing.</p>

<p>Religiously, most Scotchmen are Presbyterians
in belief and devout in spirit. They are no
people for innovations or change, even though
the new be superior to the old. I would as soon
undertake to turn the Amazon from its wonted
channel as to swerve these Scotch people from
their fixed modes of thought and habits of life.
As the boy said of his father’s horse that would
go no farther, they are “established.”</p>

<p>Just twenty years ago, the main body of our
Baptist people of this country formed what is
known as the “Baptist Union of Scotland.” They
now have eighty-five churches and ten thousand
members. Though few in number, they expect,
like Gideon’s band of old, to come off conquerors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
at last. All the Baptist ministers whom I have
chanced to meet have received me into their confidence,
into their homes and families. They
have extended to me every act of kindness and of
courtesy that I could ask or wish.</p>

<p>In a month from now, the people of Scotland
will have very little night. In the latter part of
June they have twilight until eleven o’clock, and
the sun rises about two o’clock in the morning.
It is now almost ten o’clock at night, and I can
see to write without artificial light, and the moon
is not shining.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">LEAVING Dundee I run down to Edinburgh
to attend the annual meeting of the established
church of Scotland. I am anxious to
see this venerable body of men, whose deep-toned
piety has pervaded the nation, and who wield such
a powerful influence over the political and religious
thought of the century. Whether around
the family fireside, or on the public platform, most
of these men are dignified, stiff and formal in their
bearing. I can but think that if they were put
under the water, the starch would be taken out of
them, and they would be more useful to the world.
I say to a friend that if I had only a little Baptist
water and Methodist fire, I could get up enough
steam in half an hour to set the whole convention
in motion.</p>

<p>We set out on Friday for the home of Sir Walter
Scott, some thirty miles distant. One hour
brings us to Gallashields. Here we leave our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
baggage and take the foot-path leading along the
banks of the river Tweed and terminating at Abbotsford.
The day is fine. The scenery is not
grand, but varied and beautiful. The pedestrians
are so engaged in contemplating the beauties of
nature, that the walk of five miles seems rather to
rest than to tire them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">ABBOTSFORD.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Abbotsford is situated upon a hillside about
two hundred yards from the river. Between the
house and the stream there are two high terraces,
making two distinct flower-gardens, one being
some twenty feet higher than the other. The
house is large and quaint and old. It is always
open to visitors, and daily many enter its portals.
One feels as if he would like to remain here a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
week, examining the clothes, furniture, books,
manuscripts and curiosities once belonging to
the lord of letters and of language. Here one
sees locks of hair from the heads of the Duke of
Wellington and Lord Nelson. Here one sees
the bones of many Christian martyrs; also guns,
pistols, swords, shot, shells, canteens, and other
relics of interest, gathered from the field of Waterloo
by Scott himself.</p>

<p>But we must not linger here. I want the reader
to go with me to Melrose. It is only five or six
miles, and I am sure we shall enjoy the walk, as
our winding path leads through fields, sheep-pastures,
and grassy meadows. It will be sport for
us to jump the fences, jump the ditches and babbling
brooks. We will take dinner as we sit beside
the second stream, whose limpid water will
fill our glasses.</p>

<p>Now that we have reached Melrose, let us go
at once to the old Abbey, and view that ruined
pile in which repose the body of Douglass and
the heart of Bruce, and around which the bard of
Abbotsford loved to linger. This old church, or
abbey, which for hundreds and hundreds of years
resounded with the songs and prayers of monks
and Catholic priests, was demolished by the Protestants
in the time of the Reformation, and now
serves only as the dwelling-place of blind bats
and hooting owls. After spending three hours in
and around the Abbey, and regretting that we
cannot linger three days, we leave, feeling that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
can fully appreciate, and heartily adopt the sentiment
expressed in the second canto of “The Lay
of the Last Minstrel:”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“If thou wouldst view fair Melrose aright.<br />
Go visit it by the pale moonlight;<br />
And, home returning, soothly swear,<br />
Was never seen so sad and fair.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>We now retrace our steps toward Gallashields;
and, on reaching there, are met by the Rev.
Mr. Thompson, a Baptist preacher, who takes
us to his house, and treats us so kindly that
I really regret my inability to accept his kind
invitation to remain until Sunday and preach for
him.</p>

<p>I sincerely regret that my stay in Scotland has
ended. I am loath to leave. I have walked two
hundred and fifty or three hundred miles through
the Highlands. I have viewed the whole country
through a veil of poesy which the hands of Scott
and Burns have thrown over it. To me, it is indeed
“Bonnie Scotland;” and in leaving it I can
but say:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Farewell to the land where the clouds love to rest,<br />
Like the shroud of the dead on the mountains’ cold breast;<br />
To the cataracts’ roar, where the eagles reply,<br />
And the lakes their broad bosoms expand to the sky.”</p>

<p class="p1">The night passes; morning comes. The day is
bright and beautiful. I now bid adieu to bonnie
Scotland, and set my face, for the first time,
toward merry England. It is Saturday. Hence,
I go direct to Manchester, so as to be there on
Sunday. Manchester has almost a million inhabitants.
It is the greatest cotton-manufacturing
city in the world. The great English Exposition
was opened in Manchester by the Prince and
Princess of Wales, a few days ago, and will not
close for some weeks yet. I have attended exhibitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in New Orleans, Atlanta, Louisville,
Washington City, Philadelphia and Boston, and
the main difference between an American exposition
and an English one is that in America we
make a specialty of fruits, seeds, agricultural products
and implements, fine wood, valuable timbers,
gold and silver ore, etc., while in England the
specialties are emblems of royalty, relics of antiquity,
and products of the loom and spindle.</p>

<p>The manufacturers of Manchester know much
more about cotton than do Southern planters in
the United States. They know each spring how
much cotton is planted. They study carefully
the crop prospects. They have approximately
correct ideas as to what the yield will be. They
then estimate the demand, and calculate the price.
Most of these men manufacture goods to order.
When one buys a thousand bales of cotton, he
knows exactly how much money it will cost to
work it up, how much goods it will turn out,
how much waste there will be, and how much
profit he is to reap. The people here say that the
speculators of New York frequently buy up
great quantities of cotton and hold it for better
prices. To counteract this, a paper is addressed
to the cotton manufacturers of England, and circulated
through the country. Those signing this
petition agree thereby to run their factories only
half the time until the next cotton crop is put on
the market.</p>

<p>The enterprising people of Manchester have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
inaugurated a scheme by which they will be enabled
to greatly reduce the price of their goods,
and at the same time realize greater profits for
themselves. It now costs them as much to send
their goods by rail to Liverpool, a distance of
thirty-six miles, as it does to get them from
Liverpool to New York. The new scheme is to
cut a canal from Liverpool to Manchester,
through which the great sea-going vessels can
come up to Manchester and be loaded from the
factories. For this purpose, $25,000,000 have
been raised. Work on the canal was begun
some time ago, and will be pushed most vigorously.
It will be the broadest and deepest canal
in the world.</p>

<p>To me, however, the object of greatest interest
in the city is Dr. Alexander Maclaren, who is
regarded by many competent judges as the greatest
living preacher. Six volumes of his sermons
grace the shelves of my library. My knowledge
of his personal history, and my familiarity with his
style of thought, make me all the more anxious
to see and hear the man whose eloquence sways
the multitude as the wind turns the grass of the
field.</p>

<p>Little before eleven o’clock on Sunday morning,
I enter the elegant Union Chapel, wherein are
seated some 2,500 to 3,000 persons. The preacher
soon enters the pulpit. He is somewhat under
medium size, measuring perhaps five feet and
seven inches in height, and weighing, I imagine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
about one hundred and twenty-eight pounds.
His iron-grey hair is somewhat long, is combed
straight back, and parted in the middle. His
forehead is high and broad, and projects far over
the large blue eyes which are set deep back in his
head. His mouth is small; his features are hard
and dry. He reminds me much of the late
Jefferson Davis and Dr. Henson.</p>

<p>His prayer is but the overflowing of a large
heart filled with love. The text is Matthew 3:16.
For fifty minutes the multitude is spellbound.
Dr. Maclaren’s speaking corresponds with Dr.
Henson’s definition of eloquence&mdash;it is <i>logic set on
fire</i>. The most striking peculiarity of his style is
the force with which he projects his words. As
was said of Henry Clay, each word has positive
weight. As I hear the man speaking, and feel
the force of his utterances, I am impelled to say:
“This is naught else than the artillery of heaven
besieging the citadel of the soul!” The thoughts
are projected with such dynamitic force that
resistance is impossible&mdash;every barrier is soon
broken down, then every projectile burns its way
into the soul. His words have in them scorpion-stings&mdash;they
arouse an accusing conscience.
Then a change comes over the spell of his preaching.
He says: “You now see how poor a thing is
man; how corrupt his heart; how wicked his
thoughts; how vile his deeds! So turn away
from self, and look to that Christ upon whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Spirit descended, and of whom God said, ‘This is
my Son.’”</p>

<p>I accept the Doctor’s invitation to call on him
in the afternoon. He is desirous that the Baptists
on the two sides of the Atlantic should know
each other better&mdash;that there should be a closer
bond of union and sympathy between them. He
is as pleasant at home as he is forcible in the
pulpit. I promise to go with him to a Baptist
Association, about which we shall speak in the
next chapter.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">THE Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cheshire Baptist
Associations are now holding a joint
meeting in this city of Rochdale. The
Yorkshire Association was organized in 1787, and
covered at that time all the territory that is now
embraced within the three Associations above
named, the division having occurred by common
consent in 1837. This is therefore the centennial
year for the Yorkshire, and the semi-centennial
year for the Lancashire and Cheshire Associations.</p>

<p>This is also the English Jubilee year, being the
fiftieth year of the reign of Queen Victoria. Hence
this meeting is called “The Baptist Centennial
and Jubilee Celebration.” It is said to be the
grandest Baptist meeting ever held in England.
It represents the brains and culture of our denomination
in this country.</p>

<p>They are more formal in their methods of conducting
the business of the body than is customary
among American Baptists. The program is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
out and printed beforehand. The speeches are
all “cut and dried.” The moderator asks a particular
man to make a certain motion, and then
specifies another one and asks him to second the
motion. The present meeting is mainly taken up
with historical and biographical discussions.</p>

<p>As a rule, the delegates are men of fine natural
powers and scholarly attainments. Most of them
are fluent speakers, though very few of their
number can be called eloquent or even forcible.
It is natural that on this occasion the speakers
should indulge freely in self gratulations. They
are proud of their history, and especially of their
ancestors who made their history. And well they
may be. Their ancestors were men of backbone,
of nerve and stamina! Unlike many men of the
present day, they <i>believe something</i>! Their convictions
were deep, strong, pungent! Their convictions
were strong enough to lead them to the
stake. And then they had the courage of their
convictions. They were not ashamed to let the
world know what they believed.</p>

<p>In some respects, I regard the present Baptists
of England as unworthy sons of their distinguished
ancestors. They boast of their progress, of
their broad sympathies, and liberal views; that
they have gotten away from the bones of theology
to the gospel of Christ; that they no longer preach
of God’s avenging wrath, but rather of His forgiving
mercy. These English Baptists are good men,
and they preach the gospel as far as they go; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
they do not go far enough. Jehovah is a God of
justice as well as of mercy. A body of theology
without bones is as useless as a human body without
bones. They seem to be sadly lacking in that
deep, heart-felt conviction, and in that sturdy, lion-like
courage which immortalized their forefathers.
They have well-nigh ceased to preach our distinctive
doctrines as Baptists, and God, I believe,
as a consequence, is withholding His blessings
from them. Within the bounds of these three
Associations, live more than one-fourth of the
population of England, and yet the Associations
report only 34,000 members. A church may believe
and practice whatever she pleases as to communion
(and other things too, I suppose), and
still secure or retain membership in any of these
Associations.</p>

<p>The leading features of the meeting are as follows:
An address on “Reminiscences of Associational
Teachers in 1837,” by Rev. John Aldis; the
Centennial Sermon, by Dr. Alexander Maclaren,
and an address on “Sunday Schools,” by the
Right Hon. John Bright, Member of Parliament.</p>

<p>Mr. Aldis is a remarkable man. He has been
in the ministry sixty years, and still retains much
of the strength and enthusiasm of youth. Possessing
such splendid gifts, and having been so long
connected with the Associations, there is no man
living better able to perform the task assigned to
him than the venerable John Aldis. The address
is a model of condensation. The speaker was almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
as laconic as the tramp who called, late one
evening, at a country residence, and said to the
lady of the house: “Madam, will you please give
me a drink of water? I am so hungry I don’t
know where I am going to sleep to-night.” I
wonder that one can say so much in so short a
time. There is scarcely a superfluous word from
beginning to end. It is marked, too, by great
literary excellence, and contains some delightful
bits of character sketches.</p>

<p>Doctor Maclaren is at his best. I doubt
whether he ever preached a better sermon than
the one he delivers at this meeting. He warns
his brethren that there is danger ahead, that false
theories are creeping into their creeds, that it will
never do to cut loose from the “old moorings.”
He says in substance: “Brethren, the cold winds
from the icy caves of Socinianism are chilling our
blood and benumbing our limbs. We boast of
becoming liberal-minded and broad. We should
not forget, however, that broad streams are shallow,
and that narrow ones are deep. Their currents
are apt to be swift enough to cut up the
mud and wash out the riff-raff from the channel,
leaving a smooth, solid rock bed. God’s Word
may lead us into deep water, but it will never
leave us without a solid foundation. There is
such a thing as being broader than wise, and
wiser than good.” For more than an hour his
audience of three thousand persons is under his
magic power. At times they are breathless. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Doctor plays upon the fibres of men’s hearts like
a skillful musician upon the strings of his harp.
He strikes any chord&mdash;every chord&mdash;he pleases.
The audience can neither resist laughter nor
suppress tears. Every heart is pierced by the
orator’s fiery glance, and thrilled by his matchless
eloquence. As Goethe said of Herder, “He
preaches like a God.”</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of the meeting reaches its
zenith Wednesday afternoon, when the Right
Hon. John Bright delivers an address on “Sunday-schools.”
The excitement is simply intense.
One round of applause follows another until the
very walls of the building are made to ring with
glad huzzas. Then those who can not gain entrance
to the immense hall take up the cry, and
send it ringing through the streets of the city.
The excitement really becomes painful. Mr.
Bright is quite old and feeble&mdash;his head is white
as cotton, still he is a perfect master of assemblies.
As an orator, he is much after the style
of the late Brooklyn divine.</p>

<p>One touching incident must be related. Mr.
Bright stands before the audience motionless, until
silence is restored. He then calls Mr. Aldis to
him. As the two venerable men stand side by
side facing the audience, with their hands on each
other’s shoulders, Mr. Bright relates the following
incident: “I first met Mr. Aldis fifty-four years
ago. We were then just entering upon the duties
of life. On the day of our meeting, each of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
delivered an address to a large assembly. Mr. Aldis
was my senior. He spoke first, and I second.
After the speaking was over, he took me to one
side. He said that he saw in me powers that
should be developed. He told me how to develop
those powers. In a word, he lectured me on
public speaking. This, ladies and gentlemen, was
my first and last lesson in elocution.” Then,
turning to his old teacher, he continued: “Mr.
Aldis, if I have accomplished anything in life, and
especially as a public speaker, it is due, at least in
part, to your kindly counsels. We met first fifty-four
years ago; this is our second meeting; our
third will be in Heaven.”</p>

<p>The meeting has just closed. It was an unequivocal
success. The arrangements were simply
perfect. No weak plank was put in the platform.
Every speaker was true and tried, and everything
passed off with an eclat that is pleasing to contemplate.
A daily paper, in speaking of the
meeting, says: “The Baptists were seen at their
best, and they are justly proud that it was a very
good best.”</p>

<p>These English Baptists have been exceedingly
kind and courteous to me. I was entertained by
Hon. John S. Hudson, Mayor of the city. It
seemed that Mr. Hudson and family could not do
enough for their American guest. Their kindness
will never be forgotten.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi12">AFTER attending the Baptist Centennial at
Rochdale, I turn my face toward the east,
Nottingham being the objective point. Four
hours bring me to my journey’s end, and the
reader can scarcely imagine my feelings when, as
I step off the train at Nottingham, I am arrested
by a sturdy Scotchman. I say to him: “Sir, what
does this mean? If you seek for some criminal,
some culprit who has violated the laws of the land,
you have caught the wrong bird. I am a loyal
citizen of the United States of America. I have
the necessary papers from government officials to
prove what I say. I was never accused of an
ungentlemanly or illegal act in America, and since
coming to England I have behaved myself; I
have kept good company; I have respected your
Queen and obeyed the laws of your country.”</p>

<p>Although I am as composed as a judge, and
notwithstanding the fact that my words ring out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
like the notes of a silver bell, my speech falls flat.
The Scotchman declares that it is entirely unnecessary
for me to say another word; that I am
his prisoner; that I shall be locked up, but shall
not be maltreated; that I shall be dealt with fairly,
and, if innocent, released in due time. Strange
feelings come over me as I am led captive through
the crowded streets of this busy city to be locked
within the gloomy prison-walls of a foreign country.
Fortunately, however, the darkest hour is
just before day. We have not gone far, when the
Scotchman throws off the mask and reveals himself
as my bosom friend, and fellow-countryman,
George Robert Cairns, who is well-known and
much beloved from Ohio to California, and who
has sung and preached his way into the hearts of
thousands of the Scotch and English people. The
prison to which he is conducting me proves to be
one of the most pleasant and elegant homes in
the city. Hence, I feel that I can say with David,
“Thou hast turned my mourning into dancing;
thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me
with gladness.”</p>

<p>Nottingham is one of the oldest and most historic
cities in all England. It is splendidly situated
on the banks of the river Trent in the midst
of one of the prettiest and most romantic regions
of country anywhere to be found in Her Majesty’s
Kingdom. The word “Nottingham” signifies
“dwellers in caves,” a name given to the town on
account of its early inhabitants dwelling in caves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and subterranean passages cut in the yielding
rock on which the present city is built. These
caves and caverns are still open, and it affords me
curious pleasure, with lantern in hand, to wander
through their dark recesses.</p>

<p>In one of the noted forests by which the town
is surrounded, stands a large and venerable oak-tree,
more than seven hundred years old, with a
wagon road cut through it. These are the lordly
forests described in Ivanhoe&mdash;the same, also,
where Robin Hood held high carnival.</p>

<p>This is the birthplace of Henry Kirk White,
whose poetical talents brought him into prominence
long before he reached man’s estate. The
bud was plucked before the flower was full-blown.
Brief, bright and glorious was his young career.
An ardent admirer from the Western world has
placed a beautiful marble tablet to his memory
in one of the halls of Cambridge University.
Many of the Pilgrim Fathers left for America
from this town and shire.</p>

<p>I was at the birthplace and home of Thomas
Cranmer, who, in 1656, perished at the stake for
the cause of Christ. The enthusiastic guide who
is but temporarily of the Archbishop’s palace
pointed to Cranmer’s portrait and said: “This is
a picture of Mr. Cranberry, a Scottish king, who,
in 1009, was condemned for heresy and shot by
order of Pharaoh.” The traveler who believes
all that the guides tell him will soon be thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
convinced that Moses was the grandson
of Julius Caesar.</p>

<p>I know not when I have enjoyed anything more
than a day spent at Newstead Abbey, the home of
Lord Byron, whose faults we cannot forget, but
whose genius we must acknowledge, and whose
poetry we cannot fail to admire. The Abbey is
now the property of Capt. F. W. Webb, who spent
many years with Livingstone and Stanley in their
African explorations. In turn, Livingstone and
Stanley used to spend much time with Captain
Webb in his elegant home. Many of the spacious
rooms and long winding halls of the Abbey are
filled with stuffed lions, tigers, bears, wolves, panthers,
serpents, and fowls brought by these men
from the Dark Continent. The Abbey itself is
about eight hundred years old. It stands in the
midst of a great forest, nine miles north of Nottingham,
and is surrounded by lovely flower-gardens,
sparkling fountains, and artificial lakes.
Here the poet wrote “Hours of Idleness.” I was
sad when I saw the splendid marble monument
which the fond master had erected to his faithful
dog. The epitaph closes with these melancholy
words:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Ye, who perchance behold this simple urn,<br />
Pass on&mdash;it honors none you wish to mourn:<br />
To mark a friend’s remains, these stones arise;<br />
I never knew but one&mdash;and here he lies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>From the Abbey I went to Hucknall, three
miles away, to see the grave of the poet, who lies
buried in a church just in front of the pulpit.
The marble slab covering the grave forms a part
of the floor, and on it are these words:</p>

<p class="pc1">“BENEATH THIS STONE RESTS THE REMAINS OF LORD BYRON.”</p>

<p class="p1">On either side of the pulpit, also, there is a
marble slab imbedded in the wall, filled with inscriptions
pertaining to the life and character of
him who, while living, struck chords in the human
heart which will continue to vibrate until the
sands of time shall have been removed into the
ocean of eternity. I must now quit the dead, and
say something about the living. I must leave the
grave, and take my stand beside the altar.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock to-day, Mr. George Robert
Cairns, of the United States, and Miss Annie
Mellors, of Nottingham, England, were united in
the holy bonds of matrimony. On three successive
Sundays previous to the wedding, according
to the requirements of law, the engagement was
publicly announced at churches, and the question,
“Does any one present object to the proposed
marriage?” was asked. It is the custom of the
country for engagements to be made public as
soon as marriage contracts have been entered
into. The young people thus engaged are at once
recognized as members of each other’s family.
Mr. Cairns’ evangelistic labors have been greatly
blest. Through his instumentality many, both in
Europe and America, have found Him of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Moses and the prophets did write. And now
that the Lord has blest him with one of the most
lovely and accomplished Christian women in
England, I feel sure his usefulness will be greatly
increased, if not doubled.</p>

<p>From Nottingham we came to Wales. We
have been here several days, bathing in the sea,
walking along the white pebbled beach, strolling
through grassy meadows, gathering wild flowers,
climbing wooded hills, and scaling rugged mountains.
When weariness overtakes the pedestrians,
they seat themselves on the shady side of some
towering crag or cliff, whose shadow falls long
and deep across the hill. Here they hold close
communion with Nature and sweet converse with
God. The pilgrims discover God’s power in the
lofty mountains, see His beauty in the blushing
rose, behold His glory and splendor in the setting
sun “vast mirrored on the sea.” These rocky
coasts, mountain peaks, and waterfalls have inspired
many a poet’s muse. Here Tennyson loves
to linger. Here Mrs. Hemans sang her sweetest
songs. Here Johnson and I roam and read.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And this our life, exempt from public haunt,<br />
Finds tongues in trees, books in running brooks,<br />
Sermons in stones and good in everything.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Baptists are numerically strong and wield
a powerful influence in Wales. They are close
communionists. They are loyal to their principles
and to their God; consequently, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>

being wonderfully blest&mdash;they are flourishing like
the green bay-tree.</p>

<p>The Episcopal Church is fast losing ground in
this country. The people are crying out against
the tithe system, and are calling for dis-establishment.
This once proud structure is tottering.
Many predict a speedy fall; and, if it falls at all, I
believe the crash will be heavy enough to jar and
injure the foundation of the established church
throughout the empire. I say it kindly and in
the right spirit: I hope that the Episcopal Church
will be disestablished. If it be of man, it ought
to fall. If it be of God, it needs no human
government to support it. If a church be of God,
its devotees need to look to Him, and not to the
State, for strength. The lack of governmental
support never yet stopped the work of saving
souls. Against Christ’s Church, neither the powers
of earth nor the gates of hell can prevail!</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Truth crushed to earth shall rise again:</p>
<p class="pp7">The eternal years of God are hers;</p>
<p class="pp6">But Error, wounded, writhes with pain,</p>
<p class="pp7">And dies among his worshippers.”</p>

People Together&mdash;Lost in London&mdash;A Human Niagara&mdash;A Policeman and
a Lockup&mdash;The Jubilee and the Golden Wedding&mdash;”God Save the Queen.”

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/cap-i.jpg" width="25" height="60" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi08">I ENTER London for the first time on Saturday
at 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> It is with the greatest difficulty
that I obtain lodging. I am turned away
from several hotels, boarding-houses, and private
homes. I can not get even a cot, or blankets, to
make a pallet on the floor. I continue to press
my suit, however, and finally secure good accommodations
with a private family.</p>

<p>Why all this difficulty? It arises from the fact
that this is the week set apart for London and
the surrounding country to celebrate the Queen’s
Jubilee, this being the fiftieth year of her reign.
For some days the streets have been absolutely
crowded with visitors. It is said that there are
more people here now than ever before. It is a
difficult matter, I am sure, for one who has never
been here to realize what this means.</p>

<p>London occupies a good part of four counties,
covering an area of one hundred and twenty-five
square miles. This area is traversed by 7,400<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
streets which, if laid end to end, would form a
great thoroughfare, eighty feet wide, reaching from
London to New York. And yet these streets are
far too few, too narrow, and too short, to accommodate
the six and a half millions of people
who are now crowded into the city to attend the
Jubilee. There are, in London, more Scotchmen
than in Edinburgh; more Irish than in Dublin;
more Jews than in Palestine; more Catholics than
in Rome. There are more people in London
to-day than live in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago,
Boston, Cincinnati, Louisville, New Orleans,
St. Louis, Kansas City and San Francisco all
combined. There are more than half as many
people here as live in Mexico, and more than one-tenth
as many as inhabit the whole of the United
States of America.</p>

<p>Monday morning, at ten o’clock, I started out,
like Bayard Taylor, with the determination to lose
myself in this great city, and I hope that it will
not be considered egotistic in me to say that I
was eminently successful. Indeed, I have never
been more successful in any of my undertakings
than in the effort to lose myself in London. I
wandered through the streets for hours and hours,
going up and down, to the right and left, across,
zigzag, and every other way, paying no attention
whatever to the direction in which I was going, or
to the distance that I had traveled. Johnson and
I were soon separated from each other. I was
alone, all alone! Who can describe that lonely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and woe-begone feeling which comes over one as
he, for the first time, winds his way through the
great crowd that constantly throngs the streets of
the world’s metropolis! A lonely, desolate, miserable,
and depressing feeling takes hold of your
spirit. You cannot shake it off. After walking
until your weary limbs can scarcely support you,
you sit down upon some curb-stone, or door-step,
to rest, to meditate, to dream. Your head turns
dizzy as you sit there and watch that human Niagara
dashing by you! In vain, you scan the
care-worn faces of the passers-by for a familiar
countenance. You can only comfort yourself with
this consoling thought: “I know as many of them
as they do of me.” Ah! who knows&mdash;who can
know&mdash;that mixed multitude? Who can tell
whether courage or cowardice, whether hope or
fear, whether virtue or vice, whether joy or sorrow,
whether peace or strife, most rules the heart?
One man in the crowd continually thinks of the
low, the mean, the vile, and is himself corrupt
and vicious. Another has pure thoughts and
lofty aspirations; he has an eye for the beautiful;
he loves the true, and longs to be good.</p>

<p>Here is a demon of darkness, whose heart is
black with the crimes of last night&mdash;yea, with the
accumulated crimes of a life-time. His conscience
is dead. He would now like to stifle the courage,
to throttle the hope, and stab the virtue of others.
There is a good Samaritan whose acts are acts of
kindness, and whose deeds are deeds of charity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
He is in the world, but not of the world. He is a
stranger. He is a pilgrim. His citizenship is in
Heaven!</p>

<p>For several hours I watched the passing throng,
and read their thoughts as best I could. At
length I came to myself. I felt as if I had been
dreaming. I found that it was seven o’clock in
the evening. I discovered that I was lost! I did
not know where I was. I scarcely knew who I
was, or whence I came. I had forgotten the
name and place of my room. I walked on, going
I knew not where. The sun set in the east.
Water ran up stream. I found that I had not
been wise, but otherwise. My pockets had been
searched. My money-purse was gone; fortunately,
however, it was almost empty. I had very little
small change, and nothing to make it out of.
Eight o’clock came, then eight thirty&mdash;things were
getting desperate! I sought a policeman, and
asked him to help me find myself. Without any
reluctance whatever, he took charge of me. He
told me to follow him. I did so; and, just as the
clock struck ten, the key turned, I heard the
bolt slam, and found myself locked for the night
within&mdash;my own room. This ended my first day
on the streets of London.</p>

<p>Tuesday is the Jubilee Day, the day of the
Golden Wedding, the day when Queen Victoria
and her people are to be married a second time,
after having lived together for fifty years as
sovereign and subjects. God favors us with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the people here call “Queen’s weather,” a perfect
day. The morning is bright, the sky cloudless;
the air is pure, and the breeze refreshing. Johnson
and I leave home early, and reach Trafalgar
square before seven o’clock in order to secure a
good position from which to see what promises
to be one of the greatest royal processions ever
witnessed. Although we are on the scene early,
thousands and tens of thousands of people have
preceded us. Some came at two o’clock in the
morning that they might secure favorable positions.
Many paid from ten to one hundred dollars
for seats. Fortune smiles on Johnson and
me. We obtain good vantage-ground, the only
charge being “long standing.”</p>

<p>By nine o’clock, the route along which the procession
is to pass is the most thickly populated
part of the globe that I have yet seen. The broad
sidewalks and streets are a solid mass of humanity.
The large parks, sometimes covering acres,
are filled with men, women and children, packed
to suffocation. The streets, steps, verandas, windows,
and housetops are all filled. At 9:30, all
are driven out of the streets proper, crowded
back on the sidewalks, into the lanes, by-ways,
open squares, and public parks along the route.
Persons on the opposite sidewalks face each
other. Just in front of the crowd, close back to
the curb-stone on either side, stands a line of
large, able-bodied policemen, shoulder to shoulder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
elbow to elbow, the two lines facing each
other.</p>

<p>In front of the police force, is a line of armed
infantry, standing at “attention,” with fixed bayonets.
Still in front of these, is stationed a line
of cavalrymen, all splendidly dressed and well
mounted. Each has a gun and a pistol buckled
to his saddle, and a glittering sabre in his hand.
Thus the whole route, extending for miles and
miles, is flanked on either side by three columns
of armed men. Buntings of every color, and the
flags of all nations, are fluttering in the breeze.
The richest floral designs that art can fashion, or
that money can purchase, adorn the way. The
route is lined from end to end with wealth, beauty,
and chivalry of the English Isles. See! Far in
the distance the royal trumpeters are coming, on
black chargers, flourishing their golden trumpets,
and shouting to the expectant multitude, “The
Queen is coming!” The shout is taken up and
repeated by a thousand times a thousand voices:
“The Queen is coming! The Queen is coming!”
The enthusiastic cries come rolling down the
avenue like waves on the ocean. It strikes the
fibres of every heart. The electric current flashes
along the whole line&mdash;every man feels the shock.
The welkin rings with deafening cheers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The procession itself defies description. It
consists of some fifty or sixty regal carriages all
filled with royal personages&mdash;kings, queens, and
crown princes. Each carriage is drawn by four&mdash;some
of them by eight&mdash;large horses wearing
silver-mounted harness. Each carriage is attended
by thirty life-guards, well mounted, and armed
to the teeth. The Queen’s escort consists of
thirty royal princes. The procession passes on
to Westminster Abbey, and there, in the presence
of the congregated royalty of earth, Victoria is
crowned Queen of England and of India, after
having been fifty years a sovereign.</p>

<p>Every civilized nation under heaven has contributed
to the pageantry of this occasion. For
the last half century, Victoria has been weaving
for herself a crown which the nations of the earth
do this day rejoice to place upon her brow. She
has magnified her office. Is she jealous? it is of
her honor. Is she ambitious? it is for the glory
of her country. Is she proud? it is of what her
people have accomplished. Is she mighty? it is
to succor the oppressed. She is exalted, yet
humble; dignified, yet courteous; a sovereign, yet
a willing subject of the lowly Nazarene. Elizabeth
is called England’s greatest queen; but
Victoria is, unquestionably, her best. And,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Howe’er it be, it seems to me<br />
’Tis only noble to be good.<br />
Kind hearts are more than coronets,<br />
And simple faith than Norman blood.”</p>

<p class="p1">The Victorian era will be known to posterity as
“the golden period of English history.” Victoria
has been a mother to her children and a benefactor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
to her people. She has developed her
country, advanced the arts and sciences, and
founded hospitals and asylums. May the good
Queen live long to rule righteously, to glorify
motherhood, and adorn her palace with Christian
virtues. And may the angel of peace long guard
her realms!</p>

around in a hansom, or a carriage, as most
tourists are, and sees only the museums and
art galleries, the botanical and zoological gardens,
the monuments and statues, the costly cathedrals
and splendid temples, the lordly mansions and the
superb palaces, of the city, leaves with a false, imperfect,
distorted, and one-sided idea of the place.
I would advise no man to come here, and leave,
without visiting Westminister Abbey and the
Houses of Parliament, without going to St. Paul’s
Cathedral, to the Tower, and a dozen other places
of general interest, “where travelers do most congregate.”
These things one should see, as a
matter of course, but other things should not be
left unseen.</p>

<p>I love to study architecture, art and literature;
I love to study poetry and science; but, above all,
I love to study <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>Some years ago, I saw a gentleman in Queen’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
College, Toronto, Canada, who received a good
salary from the government to study cat-fish.
Men spend many years and much money in studying
birds. And is not one fish sold for a penny,
and two sparrows for a farthing? Man is of more
value than many fishes and sparrows. Then, why
not study man? Nor is it enough to study men
individually; but we must study them collectively
as well. And, for this collective study of mankind,
there is no better place to be found anywhere
beneath the shining stars than the city of London.</p>

<p>As I sit alone in my room to-night, my conscience
hurting me for disobeying the counsels of
a devoted mother in keeping this late hour, and
look down upon the “life circulation” of the city,
I realize that it is true sublimity to dwell here.
“I am listening to the stifled hum of midnight,
when traffic has lain down to rest. I hear the
chariot wheels of vanity rolling here and there,
bearing her on to distant streets, to halls roofed
in, and lighted to the true pitch for folly. Vice
and misery are roaming, prowling, mourning in the
streets, like night-birds turned loose in the forest.</p>

<p>“The high and the low are here, the joyful and
the sorrowful are here; men are dying here; men
are being born; men are praying&mdash;on the other
side of the brick partition, men are cursing;
around them is all the vast void of night. The
proud grandee still lingers in his perfumed saloons
or reposes within damask curtains. Wretchedness
cowers into truckle-beds, or shivers, hungerstricken,
into its lair of straw. In obscure cellars,
squalid poverty languidly emits its voice of
destiny to haggard, hungry villains, while landlords
sit as counsellors of state, plotting and
playing their high chess game, whereof the pawns
are <i>men</i>.”</p>

<p>“The blushing maiden, listening to whisperings
of love, is urged to trust him who, in all probability,
seeks to rob her of that crown of glory
without which woman is indeed a ‘poor thing.’
A thousand gin palaces are open, and are at this
moment crowded with drinking and drunken men
and women&mdash;perhaps far less of males than of females.
Gay mansions with supper rooms and
dancing halls are full of light and music and high-swelling
hearts. But, in yonder condemned cells,
the pulse of life beats tremulous and faint. The
sleepless and blood-shot eyes look through the
darkness that is around and within for the last
stern morning. Full three millions of two-legged
animals lie around us in horizontal positions,
their heads in night-caps and their hearts full of
foolish dreams. Riot cries aloud and staggers
and swaggers in his rank dens of shame.”</p>

<p>“The mother, with streaming hair and bleeding
heart, kneels over her pallid, dying infant, whose
beastly father is drunk and cursing; all these
heaped and huddled together with nothing but a
little carpentry and masonry between them; all
crammed in like salted fish in their barrel, or
weltering, shall I say, like an Egyptian pitcher of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
tamed vipers, each struggling to get his head
above the others.” This is as true now as it was
in Carlyle’s day. Such work goes on every night
of the year. Having seen these things myself, I
speak what I do know. I am truly glad that
London is in England, and not in our beloved
country. I hope we may never have a city as
large as this, for I am thoroughly convinced that
it is not good for so many men and women to
dwell together.</p>

<p>If it were possible for five millions of men to
come together to live and do business in the
same city, each having the same amount of money
in the struggle of the survival of the fittest which
would follow, a few men would soon have great
wealth, and others would be reduced to poverty
and want. The successful ones would then become
proud and haughty, overbearing and dictatorial.
Some of the others would, like the ass
in the tread-mill and ox under the yoke, be
doomed to a life of toil and servitude. Another
class of the unfortunate ones would become despondent,
wretched, reckless, indolent and selfish.
The hard-hearted would set dead-falls and snares
to catch their weak-minded and strong-passioned
brother. This would go on and on until thousands
would lose their manhood and womanhood.
They would abandon all hope and courage and
virtue. They would resort to treachery, lying,
stealing, gambling, and murdering. They would
thus degenerate into the lowest, vilest, meanest
specimens of humanity.</p>

<p>This is London. I have seen more wealth,
more of the trappings of place and pride, more
worldly pomp and regal splendor, than I have
ever seen anywhere else. I have also seen more
poverty, suffering, vice, and ignorance than I ever
expected to find in a country so highly favored
as is England.</p>

<p>Having spoken somewhat at length of the lower
strata of London life, let us now look at the
praiseworthy efforts that are being made to elevate,
humanize, moralize, and Christianize these
hope-abandoned wretches. What is known as the
“East End” is the worst part of the city. It is
inhabited by a million and a half of people, most
of them being the off-scouring of creation&mdash;not
“the bravest of the brave,” but the vilest of the
vile. Just in the midst of this den of shame and
corruption stands the “Great Assembly Hall”
which, for the last eleven years, has been open
day and night for gospel work.</p>

<p>Mr. Fred. M. Charrington, the Superintendent
of this Mission, has a strange and interesting
history. His father was a strange man of great
wealth, and one of the largest brewers in London.
He had only two sons, who were the sole heirs of
his immense fortune and lucrative business. The
sons had all the advantages of a thorough education
and extensive travel. Fred served twelve
months as brewer to the Queen. But, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sixteen years ago, as Fred. Charrington (then
twenty-one years old) was returning from a continental
tour, he chanced to fall in with a gospel
minister. When the preacher spoke of man’s
duty to serve God, Charrington protested. He
said they had had a pleasant time together, and
he did not care to have their peace disturbed, or
friendship broken, by the introduction of such subjects
as man’s sin, Christ’s righteousness, death,
hell, and the judgment. This conversation led to
Charrington’s conversion. After that, he worked
in the brewery all day, taught the Bible to classes
at night, and preached the gospel on the streets
every Sunday. He soon saw, however, that he
could not successfully teach the Bible, and preach
the gospel on Sunday, to people who were drunk
on the beer and whiskey that he had sold them
during the week. This so troubled his conscience
that he gave up a business that was bringing him
an annual income of more than $25,000. He then
established this Mission in East London, which
has grown to be the largest and most successful
work of the kind in the world. The Assembly
Hall, with the property belonging to it, is valued
at $250,000, Charrington having given about one-third
of the money out of his own pocket. He
has more than 2,500 members in his church.
He is strictly an immersionist. Before one can
possibly become a member of Charrington’s
church, he must sign a pledge neither to drink,
nor buy, nor sell whiskey, beer, or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
strong drink. His Sunday audiences range from
4,000 to 5,000.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL.</p>

<p>In connection with the Mission, there are a
coffee saloon, a bookstore, Young Men’s Christian
Association, Young Women’s Christian Association,
a news-boy and boot-black mission, a penny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
savings-bank, an emigration bureau, a house of
correction for bad boys, and a reformatory for
young women. All departments of this wonderful
Mission move on with the regularity of clock-work.
I have preached and lectured for Mr. Charrington
a few times, and have half-way promised to spend
a month with him next year. I love to be with
him. He is full of hope. The spirit of God is
upon him. Verily old things have passed away,
and all things have become new to him. The
things he once loved he now hates, and the things
he once hated he now loves. A new song has
been put into his mouth&mdash;even the song of Zion.
Oh, the power, the wonderful power, of the gospel!</p>

<p>The Christian people of London have expended,
and are still expending, vast sums of money
in establishing and maintaining large and successful
Missions in different parts of the city especially
in the East End, for the elevation of
degraded humanity. And nothing but the power
of God can make these people fit to live on earth,
much less to dwell in Heaven. Millions and
millions of dollars have, also, been, and are still
being, expended in establishing and maintaining
hospitals and asylums, workhouses, reformatories,
and schools. Most of these institutions are comparatively
new, but they are now splendidly fitted
up and well cared for. They will, under God, be
powerful agencies for good.</p>

<p>I was quite delighted, a few days ago, to meet
my old friend and fellow student, S. A. Smith, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Kansas. After graduating from two of our best
American institutions of learning, Mr. Smith came
to Europe to continue his studies. He has spent
three years in Germany, France, and England,
studying the ancient languages, especially the
Semitic languages. I have never known a man
with a greater capacity for work than S. A. Smith.
He is the author of two very valuable books, one
of which is just out, and is dedicated to Professor
J. R. Sampey. Such an honor was never more
worthily bestowed.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">THERE seem to be a few men in every age and
country in whom there is centred all that is
purest, noblest, and best in the moral, religious,
and intellectual life of their people. And, if
it be true, as Pope says, that “The proper study
of mankind is man,” then it is a desirable thing to
be thrown with these men who are religiously pure,
morally good, and intellectually great. “As iron
sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the countenance
of his friend.” What can be more inspiring
than to come in contact with men “on whom
God has set his seal,” and of each of whom it may
be said, as of Brutus,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“His life is gentle, and the elements<br />
So mixed in him that Nature might stand up<br />
And say to all the world: ‘<i>This is a man</i>.’”</p>

<p class="p1">I shall not now speak of England’s law-makers
and political magnates, neither of her authors and
literary lights; of these I shall have something to
say hereafter. But in this chapter I shall confine
myself to three religious leaders, who are well
worthy of our careful study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Joseph Parker, Canon Farrar, and Charles
Spurgeon are three preachers in whom, I think,
are centred all the “gifts and graces” of the English
pulpit. I listen to these men with great interest,
and, I hope, not without some profit. I study
them closely. I try, as best I can, to discover the
secret of their power and marvellous success. No
one can reasonably question their power, or deny
their success. For eighteen or twenty years, Doctor
Parker has been preaching three times a week
in the great City Temple of London. The house
holds 2,500 or 3,000 people. It is always crowded
on Sunday, at morning and night. On Thursday
at noon he has 1,200 to 1,800 persons to listen to
him. Hundreds of the best business men in the
city leave their places of employment, and go to
hear him one hour each week.</p>

<p>Frederick W. Farrar is Canon of Westminster
Abbey, and Chaplain to the Queen. The Abbey
is one of the most splendid temples on earth. As
the preacher stands in the pulpit, he is surrounded
by the busts and statues, by the tombs and monuments,
of historians and statesmen, of poets and
artists. His audience is composed chiefly of the
aristocracy of England. Here is where the dukes
and earls and lords, the kings and queens and
princes, of the nation most do congregate. To
minister in holy things, from year to year, to an
audience like this, one must, of necessity, be possessed
of splendid powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">REV. CHARLES H. SPURGEON.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of Mr. Spurgeon, what shall I say? When we
remember that there is an utter absence of what
is known as sensationalism about Mr. Spurgeon,
and yet that his audience has for the last thirty
years averaged more than five thousand people;
when we remember that his Tabernacle holds
about 6,500 hearers, and yet that hundreds and
hundreds are frequently turned away from the
doors; when we remember that his name has
become a household word throughout Europe
and America, and many of the remotest Isles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the seas; when we remember that he is one and
the same to-day, yesterday, and thirty years ago,
a living embodiment of faith in God and His
blessed Word, a perfect personification of buoyant
hope and simple, childlike trust,&mdash;I say, when
we remember all these things, we are lost in
wonder and astonishment. In writing of such a
man, words lose their power.</p>

<p>I try as nearly as possible to view Parker,
Farrar, and Spurgeon through the same glasses.
I endeavor to listen to them without fear or
favor, without preference or prejudice. All of
them say striking things, and I give here a characteristic
expression of each of the three preachers.</p>

<p>Parker: “Do children grow up as they should
grow, without the proper care and nurture?
Thistles do, flowers do not; goats do, horses do
not&mdash;and there is more of man in a horse than
horse in a man.”</p>

<p>Farrar, in speaking to the young men before
him: “I earnestly conjure you now, at the beginning
of your life’s career, to hang about your
necks the jeweled amulet of self-respect.”</p>

<p>Spurgeon: “The Lord loves all of His people,
but somehow methinks the meek are His
Josephs; upon them He puts His coat of many
colors&mdash;of joy and peace, of long-suffering and
patience.”</p>

<p>These gems of thought are, I think, illustrative
of the real difference between Joseph Parker,
Canon Farrar, and Charles Spurgeon. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
impresses me as a moral philosopher, the second
as a Christian rhetorician, the third as a gospel
minister. The first studies philosophy, the second
aesthetics, the third the Bible. The first is a
lecturer, the second a writer, and the third a
preacher. The first shows himself, the second his
culture, the third his Lord. All three of them
are great men, and it is possible that I would
change my mind as to their respective merits, if I
could hear them oftener; but I am honestly of
the opinion that, as a <i>gospel preacher</i>, Mr. Spurgeon
possesses the virtues of the other two,
without the faults of either. Like Saul, he towers
head and shoulders above his brethren. Like
the stars, the other two shine when the sun is
behind the hills, but when he arises their glory
is eclipsed.</p>

<p class="drop-capi08">I AM now in Bedford; but before writing about
this historic place, I must go back a little and
tell you something about my wayward wanderings
for the last ten days. While in Nottingham,
some weeks ago, I preached one Sunday
night in the Albert Hall to twenty-five hundred or
three thousand people. The good Lord graciously
blessed the meeting. Several persons were converted&mdash;they
found that peace which passeth all
understanding. The people insisted that I remain
and preach again, but I could not do so.</p>

<p>After visiting Wales, and spending a week or
two in London, the minister accepted an invitation
to go back to Nottingham and preach. He remained
over two Sundays, preaching both days to
the Albert Hall people. The happiest moments
of a minister’s life are when he is preaching the
gospel of Jesus Christ to a large and sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
audience, It is then that his delight reaches the
highest point on the thermometer of the soul.</p>

<p>During my stay in Nottingham, I was the guest
of a model Christian family who treated me after
the manner of royalty. Nottingham is a railroad
centre, and each day I was taken in a carriage or
by rail to see a beautiful river, placid lake, or a
towering mountain; or to see some noted forest
ancient hall, or historic castle. The members of
the family who accompanied me on these delightful
excursions were familiar with the legends, literature,
and history of the country.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went on an excursion with this
family, and sixty other Nottingham people, to
Cambridge. We were up in time to hear the
lark’s morning song. The sky was clear; scarcely
a cloud floated above us. And ere yet the bright
sun had kissed the dewdrop from off the grass, we
had turned our faces toward those classic halls
where learning lives. We dashed through many
meadows where the wild flowers were beautifully
interwoven with the green grass. We leaped
many laughing rivers, winding streams, and babbling
brooks. We wound around among many
hills, and tunneled many mountains. These tunnels
were numerous, long and dark. Now, in our
party there happened to be a newly-married
couple in the same compartment with myself, and
these tunnels were to them always a source of joy
and rejoicing. They loved darkness rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
light&mdash;why, it is not necessary for me to state.
Johnson says it was always thus.</p>

<p>At the depot, we were met by the aldermen and
deputy mayor of the city of Cambridge, who, in a
most graceful manner, informed us that we were
their guests, that they had plenty of carriages
present to accommodate the party, and would
first show us the sights of the city, and then
return to the hotel where a public dinner would
be served. We proceeded at once to the University
which comprises seventeen different colleges,
all having different names, having been founded
at different times by different persons. Each
college owns its own grounds, buildings, and
endowment fund, and has its separate faculty.
Some of the buildings are six or seven hundred
years old. They are, however, quite well preserved,
and are splendid specimens of the style
of architecture of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
King’s Chapel, the Chapel of King’s College,
was built in the twelfth century, and it is nothing
less than an architectural wonder. It is said to
be one of the most remarkable structures in
christendom. The Chapel is quite narrow, but is
well-nigh four hundred feet long, and one hundred
and twenty-five feet high. Reader, I shall not
attempt to describe this building, for, unless the
massive structure could rise before you in its
colossal proportions; unless you could go on the
inside, and actually stand upon thrilling history
as it is written in the Mosaic marble floor; unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
you could lift your eyes from the historic floor,
and see Bible stories standing out in life-like
reality as they are pictured before you in the
stained-glass windows; unless you could look up
and behold for yourself the exquisite carving on
the vaulted Gothic roof a hundred feet above
you; unless that holy calm, which these scenes
inspire and which forever inhabits these sacred
walls, could settle down upon your own spirit,&mdash;I
say, that unless you could see, realize, and experience
all these things in, and of, and for, yourself,
then it were impossible for you to appreciate
the beauty, the grandeur, the sublimity of this
splendid structure.</p>

<p>The Fitzwilliam Museum is the most handsome
modern building in Cambridge, if not in Great
Britain. It looks as if it should be placed in a
glass case and kept for the angels to inhabit.</p>

<p>In Trinity College Library, I saw the original
manuscript of Milton’s “Paradise Lost,” the
manuscript of Lord Macaulay’s “History of England,”
also the first letter that Lord Byron ever
penned; he wrote, in his mother’s name, thanking
a neighbor lady for some potatoes which she had
been kind enough to send Lady Byron. I saw
the telescope used by Newton in studying the
heavenly bodies, and by the assistance of which
he discovered new planets.</p>

<p>I was much interested in going through the
University printing establishment, and in seeing
the Cambridge Bibles manufactured. When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
got back to Nottingham, I felt that I could truly
say: “I have been through Cambridge University,
and still I may write, ‘Plus ultra’&mdash;there is more
beyond, more to learn.”</p>

<p>I bade adieu to my Nottingham friends this
morning while the dewdrops and the rays of the
sun were yet playing hide-and-seek and seek-and-hide.
Two hours later found me in Bedford. I
go at once to the church where John Bunyan was
pastor two hundred years ago. The church I
find surrounded by a huge iron fence. After
hunting for half an hour, I succeed in finding the
sexton who kindly shows me through. The front
door of the church cost six thousand dollars. It
is molded of heavy bronze. The door is divided
into twelve large panels, each panel representing
a scene taken from <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. The first
panel on the bottom of the lefthand side represents
Christian with the burden of sin on his
back, parting with his wife and children, leaving
the city of Destruction and starting out for that
city whose builder and maker is God. In the
other panels we see Christian as he passes
through the wicket gate; as he approaches the
cross and loses his burden; as he falls into the
hands of Giant Despair and is thrust into Doubting
Castle; as he passes the lions in his way; as
he sleeps and loses his scroll; as he enters Vanity
Fair; as he stands on the Delectable Mountains
from which he views the city of the blessed and
hears the music of the redeemed; and finally we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
him as he crosses the River of Death, and is welcomed
by the angels as he reaches the golden shore.</p>

<p>In the back end of the church, is a small room
containing some relics of Bunyan. Among other
things, is the chair which Bunyan occupied while
in Bedford jail, and in which he sat while writing
<i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. The iron-barred door of this
little room is the same door that locked Bunyan
in his prison cell. My blood runs cold in my
veins as I look upon the iron bolts and bars
behind which Bunyan stood and preached the
gospel to the listening multitudes as they gathered
around the jail.</p>

<p>Near by the church is the place where the old
prison stood. The prison was torn down in 1801,
the old site now being used as a market-place
during the week, and as a place for street-preaching
on Sunday.</p>

<p>At the head of High Street, near where the old
jail stood, there is a splendid bronze statue of the
immortal dreamer. The statue is more than life
size. It stands upon a tall granite pedestal, on
which is the following inscription;</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“He had his eyes lifted to heaven;<br />
The best of books in his hand,</p>
<p class="pp7">The law of truth was written upon his lips;</p>
<p class="pp8">He stood as if he pleaded with men.”</p>

<p>One hour’s walk from Bedford brings me to
Elstow. This is the birthplace of the man who
wrote the greatest book this world ever saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
excepting only the Bible. The old dormer-windowed
cottage where Bunyan first saw light still
survives the wrecks of time. On the village
green, near by the cottage, is an old church where
in early life he was sexton. Close by this church
stands Bunyan’s chapel, where he first began to
publish the glad tidings of salvation.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">BUNYAN’S COTTAGE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>At the forks of the road, about two hundred
yards from the cottage, is a lordly elm-tree, beneath
whose sheltering branches Bunyan used to
stand and preach the gospel to listening thousands.
I climb this tree, and cut several branches
of which to make pen-stocks.</p>

<p>Well, reader, I am tempted to go on and give
you the thoughts that are passing through my
mind; but I must not. Like Bunyan’s <i>Pilgrim</i>, I
am tired. I feel weak and faint. I must have
quiet and rest, so let us close this chapter.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi12">BRITISH Baptists are not one body in the
sense, or to the same extent, that American
Baptists are. If a man in America says he
is a Baptist, it is known exactly what he means.
But if a man in England says he is a Baptist, you
need further to know what sort of a Baptist he is
before you can form a definite opinion of his belief
or practice. All British Baptists are alike in
three things. They are, of course, all Immersionists;
they believe that the immersion of believers
on a profession of their faith is the only baptism
of Scripture. They are all Congregationalists;
they believe that every separate congregation of
believers is a church in itself, apart from any other
congregation, and competent to manage its own
affairs. They are all Voluntaries; that is, they
are opposed to all connection between Church
and State, and all endowments for the support of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the clergy secured or allotted to them by the law
of the land. They neither accept the patronage,
nor allow of the interference, of the civil magistrate
in matters of religion and conscience. But,
while agreed on these things, there are others on
which they differ.</p>

<p>The first principal difference between them is
indicated by the terms Particular and General
Baptists. These terms express a difference, not
of practice in regard to communion, but of creed.
Particular Baptists are professedly Calvinistic in
their creed; General Baptists are professedly
Arminian. Particular Baptists have existed in
England for a much longer period than General
Baptists. The first General Baptist church in
England was founded in about the year 1612, and
had its location in Newgate, London. After a
time, an Association of General Baptist churches
was formed; and still later, in 1770, the Association
was re-organized under the title of the General
Baptist Association of the New Connection.
The occasion for this new departure was the doctrinal
degeneracy of the churches of the old association.
“From general redemption,” says Dr. Ryland,
“they had gone to no redemption; from Arminianism
to Arianism and Socinianism.” This re-organized
Association still exists, and it still bears
the same name. The churches belonging to it
are all Arminian in doctrine. On the question of
Communion, they are divided. Some of them
practice Close Communion, and some Open.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Formerly, the churches were nearly all Close, but
Open Communionism has made considerable advances
amongst them during recent years. They
have a College at Nottingham for the education
of young men for the ministry. They have, also,
their own Missionary Societies.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">EDWARD PARKER, D. D.</p>

<p>The Particular, or Calvinistic, Baptists of England
differ in some respects from each other.
Professedly, they are all alike, Calvinists, but they
are not all Calvinists alike. Some of them are
hyper, and some of them moderate, Calvinists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
At the beginning of this century, nearly all the
Particular Baptists in the country were Hyper-Calvinists.
This resulted from the teaching of
such men as John Brine and Doctor John Gill.
The teaching of and influence of Andrew Fuller
inaugurated a change: and the change thus inaugurated
has continued and developed ever
since, so that to-day the vast majority of Particular
Baptists in Great Britain are moderate Calvinists.
The Hyper-Calvinists, however, are by
no means extinct. In some parts of England
they are rather numerous, while in almost all parts
a few of them may be found. There are amongst
them some very excellent people. They adhere
firmly to their principles. They maintain a separateness
from the world that other Christians
might profitably emulate. But, speaking generally,
they are not very aggressive in their spirit;
at any rate in the direction of efforts to spread
the truth. There is not much of the missionary
spirit amongst them. They have, however, one
Missionary Society called, with an emphasis, the
<i>Strict</i> Baptist Mission. This Mission has two
centres of evangelical work&mdash;in India and Ceylon.
In India, there are sixteen stations, and twenty-eight
workers; in Ceylon, there are six stations
and seven workers. The income last year was
nearly £700, and the expenditure about £590.</p>

<p>The Particular Baptists of Britain that are in
doctrine Moderate Calvinists are divided into
Close and Open Communionists. All the Hyper-Calvinistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Baptists are Close Communionists.
The object of their Missionary Society, to which
reference has just been made, is stated to be “the
diffusion of the Gospel in heathen lands, and the
formation of churches in accordance with the
principles of Strict Communion Baptists.” And
the churches at home are, in respect to communion,
of the same type as those which they aim to
form abroad. Vast numbers of the Moderate
Calvinistic Baptists are Open Communionists.
But this is not universally the case. There are
British Baptists that are neither extreme in doctrine,
nor loose in practice. In regard alike to
doctrine and practice, they may justly be designated,
as their American brethren are designated
Regular Baptists.</p>

<p>The question may naturally be asked: “What is
the relative numerical strength of these different
descriptions of British Baptists?” That question
it is difficult, if not impossible, to answer exactly
to its full extent. It is not difficult to determine
the relative numerical strength of the General
and the Particular Baptists. Baptists of all sorts
in Britain, according to the Baptist Hand Book
of 1890, number, churches 2,786; members 329,126.
Of these, the “General Baptist Association” contains,
churches 206; members 26,782. These figures
indicate pretty accurately the numerical
strength of the General and Particular Baptists,
respectively. But, when we come to the different
sections of the Particular Baptists, accurate information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
is not so easily obtainable. There are no
means of ascertaining how many Hyper-Calvinists
there are amongst the Particular Baptists. They
have an Association in London with fifty-six
churches, and another in Suffolk and Norfolk
with twenty-seven churches; but outside the limits
of these Associations the churches are, for the
most part, isolated from each other, and from
their brethren generally. Then again, of the
Moderate Calvinists it is not easy to determine
how many are Close, and how many are Open,
Communionists. For, while maintaining their
distinctive principles, the two often co-exist in
the same Association, and to a large extent cooperate
in general denominational work. It must
be admitted that the majority, and a considerable
majority, of the Baptists in Britain who are Moderate
Calvinists are also Open Communionists.
And this considerable majority includes most of
the largest, and nearly all of the wealthiest,
churches, together with a large proportion of the
ablest and best known ministers. Still there are
Regular Baptists in existence; nor are they,
though sometimes ignored and often reproached,
insignificant in respect to either numbers or influence.
If the whole of the United Kingdom be
taken into account, the Regular Baptists compose
a somewhat large army. They include in their
ranks most of the Baptists in Scotland. The
Scotch Baptists are strong Calvinists but not
Hyper-Calvinists, and they are Close Communionists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
They include all the Welsh Baptists.
There are in Wales 625 churches, with a total of
77,126 members; not one of these is Hyper and
they are all Close Communion. There are a few
English Baptists in Wales that are Open Communion,
but all the Welsh Baptists are Close,
whether in Wales or out of it. There are some
districts in England where Regular Baptists are
decidedly strong. In not a few districts, to meet
with a Regular Baptist church is an exception;
while in other districts it is an exception to meet
with anything else. The Rossendale district, in
the County of Lancaster, is about ten miles in
length, and five or six in breadth. It contains
sixteen Regular Baptist churches. In the Huddersfield
district, Yorkshire, which covers an area
of only a few miles, there are thirteen Baptist
churches, and eleven of them are Regular Baptist.</p>

<p>The Regular Baptists of England proper,
though not obtrusive in their character, are sturdy
and robust. They know what they believe,
and why they believe it; and they are prepared
in all circumstances, and at all hazards, to stand
by their faith. They are not a people that the
bewitchings of flattery can delude, or the terrors
of opposition daunt. Though often condemned
because of their narrowness, they are respected
by those who condemn them, because of their
firmness and consistency. They are men that can
be relied upon. In important crises, both religious
and political, they have proved themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the very backbone of the Baptist denomination.
To those around them, their ability has been
strength and their courage inspiration.</p>

<p>The denominational work of the Regular Baptists
is done, to a very large extent, through the
existing denominational Societies. Their work
in foreign missions is done through the Baptist
Foreign Missionary Society. The first secretary
of that Society was a sturdy Regular Baptist&mdash;Andrew
Fuller. And Regular Baptists still love
the Society, and are generous and hearty in their
support of it. Their Home Missionary work is
done partly through the Baptist Union, but to a
greater extent through the county Associations.
In most of the counties of England, there is an
Association of Baptist churches, distinct from the
Baptist Union, though often affiliated with it;
and in connection with these Associations there
is generally a Home Missionary Society; and,
through these different Home Missionary Societies,
Regular Baptists work with others to plant
Baptist churches and spread Baptist principles
through the land. Years ago, the Regular Baptists
sustained a separate Missionary Society for
the Continent of Europe; but the growth and development
of the missionary work in Germany,
under the late Mr. Oncken, led them to transfer
their operations to the German Baptist Mission,
which mission they continue to support. A prominent
Regular Baptist layman, Martin H. Wilkin,
Esq., of London, is the English treasurer of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the work they do through the
agencies that have been named, the Regular Baptists
of England have two Societies that are distinctively
their own&mdash;”The Baptist Tract and
Book Society,” and “The Manchester Baptist College.”
<i>The Baptist Tract and Book Society</i> came
into existence nearly fifty years ago. Previously
to that time, there had existed in England no Society,
or agency, for the printing and disseminating
of Baptist literature. This was much regretted
by some good men, who met together and
formed a Society whose object should be “to
make known” the glorious gospel of the blessed
God, “by the publication of small treatises and
tracts; and especially to disseminate the views of
Baptists relative to the doctrines and ordinances
of the New Testament.” The Society in its very
beginning, was condemned and opposed by some,
by some Baptists even; and, strange to say, because
it was Baptist. With the Religious Tract
Society in existence, they contended, a denominational
organization was, to say the least, uncalled
for. There are some amongst Baptists still who,
if they do not oppose the Society, look askance
at it, and stand aloof from it, not ostensibly because
it is Baptist, but because as Baptist, it is
not sufficiently “broad.” Nevertheless, the Society
has held on its way. Originated by Regular
Baptists, and formed on Regular Baptist principles,
it is still under the control of Regular Baptists,
and worked on Regular Baptist lines. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the same Society to-day that it was at first, except
that it is larger and stronger, and fills a more extended
sphere of usefulness. Its tracts have been
circulated, not only in Britain, but also in almost
every part of the world. And the committee report
that “encouraging communications are constantly
being received, containing testimonials to
the value of the Society’s publications, and the
signal blessings attending their circulation.”</p>

<p><i>The Manchester Baptist College</i> grew out of
an old society, first called the Strict Baptist
Society, and afterwards the Baptist Evangelical
Society. This Society was formed in the
year 1844. One of its principal objects was the
education of young men for the ministry. All the
denominational colleges in England at that time
were practically Open Communion. Professedly,
they were neutral on the Communion question;
but, as a matter of fact, all their neutrality was
on one side. All the professors and tutors were
Open Communion, and so, with few exceptions,
were the ministers sent out from them. If the
young were Close Communion when they entered
college, they, in most cases, became Open before
they left. The Regular Baptists were therefore
made to feel it incumbent upon them to establish
an educational institution of their own: first, that
they might protect their young men who devoted
themselves to the work of the ministry from influences
unfriendly to their stability in the faith
in which they had been taught; and, secondly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that their churches might be relieved from the
necessity of choosing either an uneducated man
for their pastor, or a man whose views were not
in harmony with their own. Hence the action
they took in the formation of the Society just referred
to. The plan adopted by this Society was
that of placing students who had given satisfactory
evidence that they possessed grace and gifts
suitable for the ministry of the gospel, and for
pastoral work, separately, or in twos or threes, for
a period of two or three years, under the tuitional
care and guidance of some able and experienced
pastor. Joseph Harbottle, of Accrington, uncle
of Dr. Joseph Angus, of Regent’s Park College,
London; John Shearer, of Glasgow; Dr. John
Stock, of Salendine Nook, Huddersfield; and, pre-eminently,
Thomas Dawson, of Liverpool, were
amongst the pastors chosen for this purpose. By
their personal influence, and by their devoted
labors, all these good men laid the students of the
Baptist Evangelical Society, and the Society itself,
and the Regular Baptist cause in England generally,
under deep and lasting obligation.</p>

<p>But, excellently as this plan worked for a while,
a new departure was eventually found to be necessary,
and steps were taken to establish a college.
After much thought and prayer, Chamber Hall,
Bury, Lancashire (the birthplace of the <i>great</i> Sir
Robert Peel) was secured as the home of the college,
and it was opened in October, 1866, with the
Rev. Henry Dawson, who had been for more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
thirty years the devoted and successful pastor of
the Regular Baptist church, Westgate, Bradford,
Yorkshire, as its president and theological tutor.
Soon afterwards, the Rev. Dr. Evans was engaged
as lecturer in Ecclesiastical History, and the Rev.
James Webb as classical tutor. In Chamber
Hall, the college was conducted successfully,
though with some disadvantages, for more than
seven years, when it was removed to handsome
premises, which had in the meantime been erected
in Brighton Grove, Rusholme, Manchester. The
building in Brighton Grove, where the college has
had its home for the last seventeen years, is the
property of the college. It cost more than 11,000
pounds. Previously to the removal of the college
from Bury, Dr. Evans died; and, about four years
after the removal, in the year 1877, Mr. Dawson
and Mr. Webb both resigned their respective
posts, owing to the infirmities of age. Dr. Edward
Parker was appointed president and theological
tutor in place of Mr. Dawson, and the
Rev. John Turner Marshall, M. A. (London) was
appointed classical tutor in succession to Mr.
Webb, positions which they both still hold.</p>

<p>This college is the only one in England on
Close Communion lines. It has had to struggle
for its existence. Regular Baptists are comparatively
poor, and Open Communionist friends
have not looked kindly upon it. They have hindered
it in more instances than they have helped
it. Still all its needs have been supplied. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
has gained for itself a respectable position among
other colleges for the thoroughness of its educational
training and the scholarship of its students.
In the competitive examinations, last May, of the
Non-conformist colleges of England and Wales
a student of Manchester Baptist College came off
first with honors, and another student stood fifth
in the first division. What is more important,
the College has fulfilled the expectations of its
founders in conserving and advancing Regular
Baptist principles. It has arrested the progress
of Open Communionism in Regular Baptist
churches. It has filled the pulpits of more than
seventy churches, a large proportion of which
were formerly filled by ministers of Open Communion
sentiments. The College is, in a very
eminent sense, the hope of the Regular Baptist
cause in England. It has done a great work for
that cause already. If it is still encouraged, as
there is every reason to believe that it will be, by
the same devoted generosity that its friends have
extended to it hitherto, it will yet do still greater
things.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi15">WINDSOR Castle, the winter residence of
England’s Queen, is situated on the Thames
about twenty miles from London, and possesses
many interesting features. The property
of the Castle comprises a number of towers, gates,
mansions, barracks, chapels, and other structures.
The principal portion occupies two courts of spacious
dimensions, an upper and a lower, there being
a large round tower (or keep) between, in which
the Governor resides. This tower rises 220 feet
above the Thames, and it is said that on a clear
day twelve counties can be seen from its summit.</p>

<p>St. George’s Chapel is an elegant Gothic edifice
where the royal family occasionally attend divine
services. The Albert Memorial Chapel is another
place of worship, which was fitted up by
Queen Victoria in memory of her late husband.
Here is his tomb, although his bones are buried
three or four miles away in the royal park. The
Chapel is inlaid with costly marbles of various
kinds, and it is said that the Queen spent an enormous
sum in beautifying the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The greatest interest of the Castle centres itself
in what is called the State Apartments. These
are a series of large rooms richly decorated, some
of them with gildings, paintings and tapestry,
others with a collection of warlike armor and
weapons of former centuries. It must be borne
in mind that these premises have been occupied
by the royal family for many centuries. These
walls have several times surrendered their royal
inmates to the executioner, who came in the name
of law to avenge political wrongs.</p>

<p>The large park adjoining the Palace grounds is
almost a fairy garden. It contains many artificial
lakes and flowing fountains, a great variety of
shrubbery, and a rich profusion of flowers. Statuary
abounds. Deer, elks, antelopes, and other wild
animals, are numerous.</p>

<p>Standing in front of the Palace, one looks down
the “royal avenue” stretching out in a straight
line for five miles before him. This splendid
boulevard is flanked on either side by lordly elms
whose swaying boughs are so interwoven as to
form a graceful and almost unbroken arch above
the drive from one end to the other. On a hot
summer day, the thick green foliage of the trees,
flings a grateful shade upon the drive.</p>

<p>This is a gala day at Windsor. The Castle is
decorated, and filled with royal guests. Twenty
thousand people are assembled in the park. At
two o’clock the Queen and her visitors form a
procession at the Palace, and pass slowly down
the avenue between the two rows of elm-trees.
Reaching the far end of the boulevard, they turn
to the left and, after driving one mile more, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
arrive at the place that is to be the scene of
action.</p>

<p>The two thousand persons who preceded the
royal procession have formed a circle about a
hundred feet in diameter. The size of the circle
is determined by a rope stretched around. The
open space is spread with a rich carpet. The
Queen, attended by her family and royal friends,
enters the charmed circle and proceeds to its centre.
After a speech, which it takes her fifteen
minutes to deliver, she proceeds to lay the cornerstone
of an equestrian monument to the late
Prince Albert Consort. This impressive ceremony
being over, the Queen approaches the
crowd, shakes hands with and speaks kindly to
those persons standing next to the rope on the
outside.</p>

<p>I could shake hands with Her Majesty, and
would do so, but my American spirit is too proud
to bend the suppliant knee to any earthly monarch.
I honor Victoria for her useful life and
deep piety, for her wifely devotion and maternal
instincts; and I would take off my hat to her as I
would have her son take off his hat to my mother.
But as for bowing the knee to her, I never can.
My knees are too stiff for that kind of exercise.</p>

</div>

<p>Two hours after leaving Windsor, I find myself
in Stratford-on-Avon, the home of our own
“priceless Shakespeare.” I spend the night here.
“A sweet English village is this Stratford, seated
on the edge of a silvery river green with turfy
banks and woody slopes, picturesque with cottage
houses and cottage gardens; crowned with
a village church, ivy-clad, surrounded by moss-grown
graves, approached by a lime-tree avenue,
and its slender spire tapering towards Heaven.”
Here Shakespeare first saw light. Here his boyhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was spent, his education received, his youth
passed, his marriage consummated. Here his children
were born and brought up. Here, too, he
yielded to that “bribeless harvester”&mdash;Death. So
this humble village has given to the world “the
greatest name in our literature, in all literature.”
Hence, Henry Bell said:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“His birthplace came to be famous,<br />
And the grave where his bones were laid;<br />
And to Stratford, the ancient borough,<br />
Nations their pilgrimage made.”</p>

<p class="p1">Strange thoughts pass through my mind, and
deep emotions stir my heart, as I wander through
the house wherein was born the man who wrote
not for an age, but for all time; as I stand in the
church of the Holy Trinity, and look upon the
grave, the tomb, and bust of him who analyzed
character as chemists analyze material substances.
He probed to the heart, and by the light of his
own genius read unuttered thoughts and discovered
the secret motives of men. Human faces
were to him so many books wherein he could
“read strange matters.” About a mile from Stratford
is the cottage of Anne Hathaway, who first
initiated Shakespeare into that sweetest and most
delightful of all human mysteries&mdash;love.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,<br />
If with his tongue he can not win a woman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">Yes, he won her, and afterwards he could say:</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“She is mine own,</p>
<p class="pp6">And I as rich in having such a jewel<br />
As twenty seas, if all their sands were pearl,<br />
The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.”</p>

<p class="p1">It is a matter of congratulation that our people
appreciate Shakespeare as much or more than
Englishmen. The register at the poet’s house
shows that at least one-half of the number who
visit his grave are Americans. Nor are our people
slow to give material proof of their love for
the myriad-minded bard. Mr. G. W. Childs, of
Philadelphia, whom to mention is but to praise,
has, within the last twelve months, erected in
Stratford a costly and beautifully designed fountain
to the memory of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>We might write many other things about our
mother country, but we must away to the Continent.
So, adieu, adieu; but I hope not a final
farewell to merry England. The English Channel
is only twenty-five miles wide, but it is usually
rough and boisterous, and is an object of terror
to travelers. As we start across, Johnson says:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea<br />
For an acre of barren ground.”</p>

<p class="pn1">But the Lord tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.
The Channel for once is all that could be desired.
The weather is pleasant, the sea placid as a lake.</p>

<p>As I land on the Continent at Ostend, the
thing that most impresses me is the fact that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
can not impress any one. The custom-house officers
surround me. I tell them who I am, where I
am from, and what my business is; yet this does
not satisfy them. I repeat my statement once,
twice, three times, and still they do not seem to
comprehend. I say: “Gentlemen, I have told my
story as plainly as I can speak. Do you now understand?”
And when I come to find out, they
do not understand what “understand” means.</p>

<p>Buildings on this side of the Channel wear a
century-old, time-touched appearance. The people
have strange, odd, and old-time ways of doing
things. For instance, they work one horse to a
two-horse wagon&mdash;not in shafts, but on one side
of the tongue. Frequently they work one ox and
one horse together. This is what Johnson calls
being unequally yoked.</p>

<p>From Ostend I go direct to Brussels, the capital
of Belgium. I happen to arrive in the city on
the day of a national celebration. Everything is
decorated for the occasion. At night the city is
beautifully illuminated, and great crowds of enthusiastic
people throng the streets. The fireworks
display is especially fine, representing,
among other things, the eruption of Vesuvius, the
Falls of Niagara, and the Battle of Waterloo. As
the standing army of Belgium is present, the officers
giving commands, and the soldiers going
through the manual of arms; as the royal bands
are filling the air with martial music; and, as in
the midst of the brilliant scene, are the bronze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
statues of Wellington and others who fought by
his side on the field of Waterloo,&mdash;it really seems
as if the memorable battle of 1815 is being re-enacted
before my eyes! I can but think of Byron’s
thrilling lines descriptive of the original battle.</p>

<p>Next morning I am up early, and am soon on
my way to the scene of action, nine miles from
Brussels, where the powers of earth came together
to wrestle for the thrones of Europe. Napoleon
was at a very great disadvantage, as Wellington
had by far the best position. On the hill where
Wellington’s army was stationed, there is now an
artificial mountain, about six hundred yards in
circumference and two hundred and fifty feet
high. This mountain is crowned with a granite
pedestal, about twenty-five feet high, on which
stands a huge bronze lion, his right foot resting
on a great iron ball representing the earth. This
king of beasts has his eyes turned toward France
and has a proud, triumphant look on his face.
There are several small monuments on the field,
marking the places where different officers and
heroes fell. The large one of which I speak was
built seven years after the battle, or one year
after the death of Napoleon on St. Helena.
There are several trees, also one small brick
house surrounded by a wall of the same material
standing on the field, just as they were on the day
of the battle. Of course, they are much riddled
and shattered by shot and shell.</p>

<p>I am much interested in a conversation with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
old man who lives where he was born, about four
miles from the battle field. He is now ninety-one
years old, hence he was nineteen years of age
when the memorable battle was fought. He saw
Napoleon on the day of the fight, and the day
afterwards was on the field and helped to bury
the dead. He saw Wellington several times, and
remembers distinctly how he looked after his
greatest victory. The old man is approaching
the end of his journey, and I am truly glad to
have met him before he crosses the river.</p>

<p>Let us now return to Brussels and enter the
Wertz Museum. We find here a picture which is
truly illustrative of Belgium hatred of Napoleon.
It is a most wonderful picture. It represents
Napoleon in hell. He is in the bottomless pit,
clad in his uniform. A great number of worn and
haggard widows and childless mothers, of ragged,
weeping orphans, of old men crippled, maimed
and halt, are crowding around Napoleon, scoffing,
jeering, and grinning at him, holding up before
his eyes and under his nose shattered hands and
arms and feet and legs, and broken heads and
bleeding hearts. The sulphurous flames are coiling
up around the unfortunate victim, while on his
face there is a double expression of agony and
remorse. When asked if I believe this picture
really represents Napoleon’s present condition,
I reply: “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”</p>

<p>One could write a volume about this splendid
collection of pictures, but I will mention only two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
or three more. I am especially impressed with
two companion pictures, twenty by thirty feet
each. The first represents hell in revolt against
Heaven. All the fiends of hell and all the powers
of darkness are arrayed against Christ and His
holy angels. Christ dismisses His angels; they
fly away, leaving Him all alone. This emboldens
the enemy, who rush on to the conflict. The
second picture is “The Triumph of Christ.” He
has hurled the fiends back headlong to their
native hell. And yet in this moment of victory
stands pitying His enemy rather than glorying in
His own achievements. I can but think: “Surely,
His ways are not our ways; neither are His
thoughts our thoughts.”</p>

<p>Another picture that impresses me very much
is “Age Offering the Things of the Present to the
Man of the Future.” An old man is holding out
to a young lad flags and sceptres representing
Power and Dominion; also glittering diamonds,
a golden harp, a name and a book, emblematic,
respectively, of wealth, pleasure, fame and knowledge.
He can take any one, but only one. I am
so afraid that the inexperienced youth will make
a wrong choice, that I want to whisper in his ear:
“Take wisdom; take understanding; forget it not.
Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee;
love her, and she shall keep thee. Wisdom is the
principal thing, therefore get wisdom. Exalt her,
and she will promote thee, she will bring thee to
honor.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">BRUSSELS is noted the world over for its
fine laces and superior carpets. The Kingdom
of Belgium is very little larger than the
state of Connecticut, and yet it maintains a standing
army of 50,000 men, while the whole of the
United States has a standing army of only 36,000.
The large army, together with the maintenance of
the royal family, impose upon the people a very
burdensome taxation. The people here know
very little about improved implements of any
kind, their work being done mostly by main
strength and native awkwardness. Belgium is
cultivated like a garden, and is as pretty as a picture.</p>

<p>We now leave Belgium. As the train dashes
across an imaginary line, “a change comes o’er the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
scene.” The soldiers wear a different uniform, the
people speak a different language, pay homage to
a different king, and handle a different money.
Money, however, is a scarce article in this portion
of the moral vineyard.</p>

<p>I have always associated the name of Charlemagne
with Aix-la-Chapelle. It is, therefore, with
no little interest that I visit this ancient and
historical city. I find this place of 80,000 inhabitants
beautifully situated in the midst of a fertile
valley surrounded by gently sloping hills. This
was the birthplace and favorite residence of Charlemagne,
the Julius Caesar of the eighth century.
This venerable place was the second city of importance
in the holy Roman Empire, its being the
capital of Charlemagne’s dominions north of the
Alps. Here thirty-seven emperors were crowned;
here ecclesiastical convocations assembled, and
from here imperial edicts went forth.</p>

<p>The Cathedral, or Muenster, built (796-804) by
Charlemagne still stands, and is one of the most
interesting objects in the city. On the right of
the principal entrance to the Cathedral is a brazen
wolf. According to the legend connected with this
quadruped, the funds for the erection of the church
having run short, the devil offered to supply the
deficiency on condition that the first living being
that entered the house should be sacrificed to
himself. The magistrate entered into the compact,
but defrauded the devil of his expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
reward by admitting a wolf into the sacred edifice
immediately on its completion.</p>

<p>I seat myself in the Imperial Throne of Charlemagne,
in which also his remains reposed for more
than 350 years, having been found by Otho III,
who opened the tomb in the eleventh century.
In the Cathedral Treasury is the famous “Shrine
of the Four Relics.” It is composed of the purest
gold, and is studded with fifteen hundred
precious stones. This shrine is said to contain
the robes of the Virgin Mary, the swaddling
clothes of the infant Christ, the bloody cloth in
which the body of John the Baptist was wrapped,
and the linen cloth with which the Savior was
girded on the Cross. The relics are shown only
once in seven years, on which occasion thousands
of people flock to see them notwithstanding the
exorbitant charges made. It has now been six
years since the last exhibition took place. The
next time for robbing the superstitious people is
close at hand.</p>

<p>The pulpit, presented by Henry II, of Germany,
is a gem of beauty, being richly adorned
with gold, carved ivory, diamonds, and other precious
stones. I dare say, however, that this Romish
pulpit, as splendid as it is, has seldom been
adorned with the precious truths of God’s blessed
Word.</p>

<p>In three hours after leaving Aix-la-Chapelle,
Cologne is in sight. Coleridge sarcastically says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Cologne has nine separate and distinct stinks;<br />
It is washed by the river Rhine,<br />
But what power divine<br />
Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine?”</p>

<p class="p1">It is not at all inappropriate therefore that
Cologne should lead the world in the manufacture
of perfumery. The city boasts 140,000 inhabitants,
the most of whom are Roman Catholics.
A bridge of boats connects Cologne with a large
city on the opposite side of the river.</p>

<p>To the visitor, the object of the greatest interest
in the city is the Cathedral, which is said to
be the most magnificent Gothic edifice in the
world. It certainly takes the palm over anything
I have seen. It is wholly unnecessary for me to
describe this wonderful building to those who
have seen it, and it is impossible to describe it to
those who have not seen it. I hardly know
whether one is most filled with admiration, or
struck with awe, as he beholds this great temple
whose foundation stone was laid six hundred
years ago. To go around it, one must walk an
eighth of a mile; and yet he forgets the distance
as he looks upon the massive walls rising one
hundred and fifty feet above him; as he views the
arched roof more than two hundred feet high; as
he eyes the tapering spires which seem to pierce
the bended sky. And yet there is hardly a square
foot, even of the exterior of this architectural
wonder, that is not carved and chiseled in the
most exquisite manner imaginable. The principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
entrance to the Cathedral is a doorway,
thirty-one by ninety-three feet. On the inside,
one sees a forest of pillars, fifty-six in number, apparently
thirty or forty feet in circumference, and
rising, some one hundred and others two hundred
feet high. The aisles are twenty, thirty, and sixty
feet wide. Some of the windows are twenty by
fifty feet. These stained-glass windows and marble
pillars have been presented by the kings and
queens and emperors of different countries. The
inside is profusely adorned and decorated with
statues, carvings, paintings and sculpture work of
every kind and character.</p>

<p>The Cathedral bell is seventeen feet across, and
weighs twenty-three tons. To ring it requires
fifteen men. As I stand upon the tower, five
hundred and thirty-seven feet above the earth,
men in the streets look like little children, and
the business houses resemble play-things. This
elevation affords a fine view of the surrounding
country. I can trace the Rhine and its tributaries
for more than twenty miles. Winding around
among the hills and grain fields, these streams,
gleaming in the sunlight, look like silver threads.
I say to my friend: “Ah! behold the ‘silver
threads among the gold.’” Although I have
climbed this spire to the enormous height of 537
feet, yet above me is a delicate golden ladder;
and, as it was placed here to enable the angels to
ascend and descend, I quietly descend.</p>

<p>The church of St. Ursula is one of the curiosities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the city. St. Ursula was an English princess
who, according to the tradition, when on her
return from a pilgrimage to Rome, in the second
century after Christ, was barbarously murdered at
Cologne with eleven thousand other Christians,
most of whom were young women. They were
all buried in the same grave. Some time in the
eleventh century the grave was opened, the bones
taken out, and, on the spot of the grave, the
present church was built to the memory of these
martyred virgins. These bones form part of the
walls of the church; some of them, also, are preserved
in glass cases, and placed around in the
audience-room. Johnson supposes this is done
to inspire in the worshipper a devotional spirit, or,
perchance, to remind him of Ezekiel’s valley of
dry bones. Near the pulpit is a beautiful monument
to Princess Ursula. The statue is of alabaster,
with a laurel wreath about her brow and
a white dove at her feet.</p>

<p>The Rhine is, indeed, a majestic river. Its
broad bosom floats hundreds of vessels, laden
with the produce of its fertile valley, and thousands
of tourists from all parts of Europe and
America. At Cologne, we embark on the “Victoria,”
and start up the “legendary stream.” As
our graceful bark glides off over the smooth
waters, we turn our eyes back toward Cologne for
a last, long look. And what a pleasing picture it
is to behold the city with its “girdle of fortifications,”
to see the splendid cathedrals and numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
towers outlined against the sky! Cologne
has scarcely vanished from our sight when Bonn
appears. Here we disembark. A few hours suffice
to go through the University, to inspect the
Cathedral, to see the bronze statue, and visit the
birthplace of the great musical genius, Beethoven,
born in 1770 and died in 1827.</p>

<p>After leaving Bonn, the scenery is more picturesque
and beautiful. On either side of the
swiftly-flowing stream, the overhanging cliffs rise
high, one above another, each being crowned with
a ruined castle, whose long, winding corridors and
pictured walls once resounded with mirth and
music. High perched upon these basaltic rocks,
and surrounded by almost impregnable walls,
feudal lords once held despotic sway. It really
seems that the once thirsty swords have been
beaten into plowshares, and the spears into pruning
hooks, for the fruitful vine now flourishes
along the “bloody Rhine,” from its water’s edge
to the height of the castled crags. Even the
crevices in the high cliffs are planted with the
vine. This scene inspired Lord Byron to sing
the following beautiful song:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The castled crag of Drachenfels</p>
<p class="pp7">Frowns o’er the wide and winding Rhine</p>
<p class="pp6">Whose breast of waters broadly smiles</p>
<p class="pp7">Between the banks which bear the vine;</p>
<p class="pp6">And hills all rich with blossom’d trees,</p>
<p class="pp7">And fields which produce corn and wine,</p>
<p class="pp6">And scatter’d cities crowning these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p class="pp7">Whose far white walls along them shine,</p>
<p class="pp6">Have strew’d a scene which I should see</p>
<p class="pp7">With double joy wert thou with me.”</p>

<p class="p1">We land at Konigswinter (King’s Winter), and
ascend the bluff, nine hundred and eighty feet
above the Rhine, to the Castle of Drachenfels, or
dragon’s rock. This Castle commands the most
extensive view of any on the Rhine. In descending,
we visit the curious cave which, according to
a mythical story, was once the dwelling-place of a
huge serpent who jealously guarded the pass and
allowed no one to ascend the cliff. A brave
knight slew the dragon, and after bathing himself
in its blood, became invulnerable and mighty in
strength. He then built the Castle on the uplifted
rock, and made himself lord of the surrounding
country.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as the sun sets, we approach the beautiful
island of Nonenwerth where, half hidden beneath
the rich foliage, we see an old convent. Just
above this floating island, rises a huge rock whose
summit was once crowned with a splendid castle,
of which only one crumbling arch now remains.
The legendary history connecting the castle and
convent is as beautiful as it is touching. Just
after the time of Charlemagne, a brave and gallant
knight, by the name of Roland, paid court to
the beautiful and accomplished Princess Hildegude.
The affection was reciprocated, and the
two soon became affianced lovers. At this time,
Roland was summoned by his king to the Crusade.
Time sped on, and anxiously did the devoted
Hildegude look for his return. But, alas!
she received tidings of his death. Straightway
for her all beauty faded from every earthly object.
She therefore gave her heart to God, and
her body to the convent on the adjacent island.
The sad news, however, proved untrue. Roland
had been wounded but not fatally. All during
his absence the fires of love burned brightly upon
the altars of devotion. With joyous anticipation,
he returned to receive the hand of her whose
radiant smile was the light of his life. But, alas!
poor Roland! He found that his lady-love was in
that living tomb from which death alone could
set her free. Broken-hearted, he built the castle,
one moldering arch of which still stands, and
there lived in solitude and wretchedness, catching
an occasional glimpse of his imprisoned love.
After her death, he spoke no more until he passed
beyond the stars to meet her who anxiously
awaited his coming.</p>

<p>The last rays of the setting sun light the lamps
of night, and it seems as if each star tries to outshine
every other one. The moon, with these
brightly-beaming stars as her attendants, comes
forth as “Empress of the Night.” Standing on
deck and looking out over the scene, I find that
moon and stars are pouring a perfect flood of
glory over tower, and castle, and crag, and cliff,
and wooded hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time we are so completely intoxicated
with pleasure that we think it best not to indulge
any longer. So, as the clerk of the boat calls out,
“Coblentz,” we step ashore, and one hour later
we are dreaming about what we had seen during
the day. Next morning, as the sun first peeps
over the eastern hills, he finds the pedestrians on
their way to Ems, a beautiful little city nestling
among the wooded hills of Germany. The walk
proves a delightful exercise; and before the dew
is off the grass, we are seated in Ems on the bank
of the river which flows through the city. This
was a favorite resort of the late Emperor William
during the summer. On the way to Ems, we have
the pleasure of witnessing a sham battle between
several thousand German soldiers. No one is
killed. One officer is badly hurt by his horse
falling on him.</p>

<p>Before eleven o’clock, we are again gliding up
the river. We seem now to have entered an enchanted
region. No description we have ever
read of the Rhine could equal the sight itself.
Here</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The noble river foams and flows,</p>
<p class="pp7">The charm of the enchanted ground,</p>
<p class="pp6">And all its thousand turns disclose</p>
<p class="pp7">Some fresh beauty varying round.”</p>

<p class="p1">The channel now becomes narrow, the stream
swift and deep. As we pass castle after castle
and behold the wrecks and ruins, we feel that we
are “passing back down the stream of time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>”
Here on the left is the Loreli, a great rock rising
up more than four hundred feet. According to
the legend, a nymph had her dwelling in a cavern
of this rock, and, with the music which issued
forth from her golden harp, she enticed sailors
and fishermen to their destruction in the terrific
whirlpools and rapids at the foot of the precipice.</p>

<p>Passing the national monument erected in honor
of Germany’s victory over France, in 1870, and
Bingen, “fair Bingen on the Rhine,” we come at
length to Mayence, a frontier town of fifty thousand
inhabitants, strongly fortified with a garrison
of thirty thousand soldiers. Mayence was
founded B. C. 14, by Drusus, the son-in-law of
Julius Caesar. Here the grandsons of Charlemagne
met to divide his mighty empire into
Germany, France, and Italy. This is the birthplace
of Gutenberg who, in 1440, invented the art
of printing. Mayence has shown her high appreciation
of that gifted son of genius by erecting
the handsome “Gutenberg Statue.”</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi12">FROM Mayence, I run up to pay my respects
to Frankfort (ford of the Franks)-on-the-Main;
and right royal is the reception extended
me. The good people of this classic city
seem really glad to see me, <i>especially the hotel
keepers</i>. Reader, you can scarcely imagine what
a pleasure it is to a way-worn pilgrim, as he enters
a great city in a foreign country, to be met by a
committee consisting of a full score of hotel clerks
and porters, and half a hundred hack drivers! As
the traveler steps off the train, he is approached
by the different members of the committee, each
of whom tries to be more kind and obliging than
any of the others. Indeed, the honored visitor is
well-nigh overcome with gratitude, as he sees these
committeemen crowding round him on all sides,
each with an expectant look, a face wreathed with
smiles, and a palm itching to get hold of his purse
strings. Such was the welcome given me at
Frankfort-on-the-Main, which city, though it dates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
back from the time of Charlemagne, 775, is now
as fresh and fair as a sixteen year old maiden
with blue eyes and golden hair.</p>

<p>Frankfort is about the size of Rochester, New
York, is a place of great commercial importance,
and, according to population, is by far the wealthiest
city in Germany. It claims two hundred
millionaires.</p>

<p>The museum and art galleries here are of the
highest type. I can not use the brush, palette, and
easel myself, but some pictures throw a spell over
me that I can not shake off. Murillo’s “Madonna
Enthroned,” Overbeck’s “Triumph of Religion in
the Arts,” Rembrandt’s “Parable of the Laborers
in the Vineyard,” are indelibly stamped on the
imperishable tablets of memory; their gilded
frames I have entwined with a garland of forget-me-nots,
and with golden cord of appreciation I
have hung them up in the art gallery of the soul.
And, if as Keats says, and as I believe, “A thing
of beauty is a joy forever,” then will my visit to
Frankfort-on-the-Main be a blessing to me until
the silver cord be loosed, and the golden bowl of
life broken.</p>

<p>This is the birthplace of Goethe, the Shakespeare
of Germany. His splendid monument
stands in the centre of one of the public squares
of the city. The pedestal on which the bronze
statue rests is relieved by raised figures, those on
one side being taken from “Faust,” and the other
from “Hermann and Dorothea.” The first is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
of the most masterly productions that ever emanated
from the human brain, and the second one
of the sweetest love stories ever embalmed in
verse. Carlyle says of Goethe: “There was none
like him; he knew everything.” If Germany ever
produced Goethe’s equal, it was his bosom friend
Schiller, whose life-like statue adorns another of
the public squares of Frankfort. Seeing these
two statues, I involuntarily look around for that of
Herder. I always think of Goethe, Schiller and
Herder as the inseparable trio.</p>

<p>The well-known millionaire, M. A. Rothschild
who, I believe was at one time the richest man on
earth, was born in Frankfort. The family still
lives, and do a large business here. Through the
influence of a friend, I gain an entrance to Rothschild’s
house and private museum, which one may
well imagine contains an elegant collection of curiosities
from all parts of the world. One gold
vase alone, set with diamonds and other precious
stones, is said to have cost 800,000 marks or
$200,000.</p>

<p>The next place the traveler hangs his hat on
the wall is here in Worms. Ah, what a history
has this quaint old German town! How many
thrilling incidents have taken place on its narrow
streets during the last fifteen hundred years! But
Worms is of more than a general interest to the
world, since it was the scene of Luther’s fiercest
struggle with Rome. In March, 1521, Luther was
summoned to appear before the Diet, or Supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Court, of half the World, assembled at Worms,
under the presidency of Charles V. With Napoleonic
courage, Luther answered the call in person.
As the bold reformer on his way to trial
passed through Eisenach, where he had sung
carols on the street for bread, his friends met him
with the warning; “They will burn you as they
did John Huss;” to which he replied; “Though
they should build a fire from Worms to Wittenberg
and reaching to the sky, I would pass through
it in the name of the Lord.” As he was approaching
the city, Spalatin sent a messenger with another
warning. This time the monk responded:
“Go tell your master that if there were as many
devils in Worms as there are tiles upon the housetops,
I would enter.” He did enter, and the next
day became a turning point in the world’s history.
It was then that this “Christian Hercules, this
heroic cleanser of the Augean stable of apostacy,”
went forth in the arena of debate to shiver lances
with kings and popes and princes. Being severely
in earnest, grandly right, and divinely appointed
to his office, he hurled his arguments like withering
blighting thunder-bolts. And, if the enemy
now and then put in hard licks, Luther, being possessed
of a cool head, quick wit, and boundless
resources, revived like the vigor of vegetation
after the stunning blow had fallen. He stood
until there was not a man to meet him. The
haughty hierarchy which he assailed had “bound
kings in chains, and nobles in fetters of iron; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
before the fire of his quenchless zeal those fetters
fell, fused as by the lightning touch of Heaven.”</p>

<p>It is only in accordance with the “eternal fitness
of things,” therefore, that we find in Worms
a monument memorializing this severe conflict
and brilliant victory of the intrepid reformer.</p>

<p>As we enter the town from the railway station,
we pass through the Luther-Platz (place or
square), in the center of which stands the Luther
Monument, which was erected in 1868 at a cost of
$85,000. The monument is on this wise. There
is a massive platform of granite, forty-eight feet
square and nine and one-half feet high, bearing in
its centre a large pedestal, also of granite. This
pedestal is surmounted by another in bronze,
adorned with reliefs representing four scenes in
Luther’s life. In the first, we see him administering
the communion as a Catholic priest; second,
he is nailing his theses on the church door in
Wittenberg; next, we see him defending himself
at Worms; and, last, he is translating the Bible
into his native language.</p>

<p>Now, upon this pedestal, whose sides are thus
adorned, stands the bronze statue of Luther, eleven
feet in height, a commanding figure. In his
left hand he holds a Bible, on which his right
hand is placed emphatically, while his face, on
which faith is admirably portrayed, is turned upwards.
John Huss, Savonarola, John Wycliffe,
and Peter Waldus are sitting at the four corners
of the large pedestal on which Luther stands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>From the four corners of the large platform,
rise four granite pedestals, not so large as the
central one. On these four pedestals stand bronze
statues of Luther’s fellow champions, Malanchthon,
Reuchlin, on one side, and Philip of Hesse and
Frederick the Wise of Saxony, his princely protectors,
on the other. The four last-named statues
are each nine feet high. Taken all in all, this
is one of the finest and most impressive monuments
I have seen. And why should it not be so?
These men have justly been called the thunderers,
the cloud compellers, the world uplifters, the hammers
of the Lord, the pioneers of progress, the
liberators of mankind,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Whose names are ever on the world’s broad tongue,<br />

<p class="drop-capi12">THE American traveler in Germany has to
seek for the Baptist churches, if he is to find
them. His Baedeker has no star to point
them out, and their commanding spires will not
arrest his eye as he strolls through the streets.
The church at Hamburg is the only one that is
notable as a piece of architecture; and its arches,
though the delight of lovers of the Gothic, are the
despair of preachers. Many of the churches still
worship in halls, and some of these halls are none
too prominent. The writer of this sketch remembers
looking for the Baptist church in a large city of
Southern Germany. He followed his clew into a
narrow street, then through an overhanging archway
into a still narrower court, up two flights of
stairs to a door from which his knock drew no
voice nor sound of an answer. The Baptist church
at Leipzig has its place of worship in one of the
suburbs, about three miles from the centre of the
city, and away from the bulk of the membership.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
How many of those who have studied there know
that there is a Baptist church in Leipzig? Of
course our Baptist Brethren do not choose obscurity
and inconvenience from any predilection
for them, but from due deference to the ever-present
question of rent. Ground is high, and
Baptist money scarce.</p>

<p>However, many of the churches have gradually
worked their way to the possession of chapels of
their own. But even these present no very
churchly appearance. The ground has to be
utilized carefully. Dwelling apartments have to
be built over, or under, or in front of, or back of,
the auditorium of the church, sufficient at least
to house the pastor, and often sufficient to bring
an income that will carry the interest on the debt.
But the work is growing. Better accommodations
are being secured. Even now there are
chapels seating over a thousand people. Several
churches in the large cities, for instance, at
Berlin and Königsberg, have two church buildings,
without, however, on that account dividing
the church organization.</p>

<p>The “statistics” for 1889 reports 106 churches
with 20,416 members in Germany proper, and 123
churches with 23,976 members in the entire “Bund,”
which includes the churches in Austria, Switzerland,
Holland, Roumania and South Africa, all of
which are organically connected with the German
Baptist Mission and off-shoots from it. Fortysix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
churches in Russia with 12,448 members, and
21 churches in Denmark with 2,711 members,
which formerly belonged to the German “Bund,”
have recently formed organizations of their own.
It is wonderful to think that such a growth has
been attained within so short a time. It was only
in 1834 that the first seven believers were baptised
in the Elbe by Professor Barnas Sears. Twenty-five
years later, they had grown to a thousand
times seven.</p>

<p>The first twenty-five years were full of privations
and persecutions. The reader will understand
that in Germany the maintenance and regulation
of religion is considered one of the duties
of the State, and a disturbance of religious order
was punishable by law, just as a disturbance of
social order would be with us. It seemed outrageous
and detrimental to the interests of society
that artisans and laborers should assume to teach
and preach, and even to administer the ordinances.
Existing laws were applied to them, or
new laws were framed to meet their case. As
late as 1852, a law was enacted in the principality
of Bückeburg, a small state in northern Germany,
providing that any emissary of the Baptists found
within the boundaries of the principality should
be imprisoned for four weeks, and that the punishment
should be doubled on a repetition of the
offense. Any one attending the meetings was to
be imprisoned for four weeks; any one conducting
them, for eight weeks; any one baptising, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
administering the Lord’s Supper, for six months.
One of the old veterans of those days has counted
up that he was imprisoned thirty-three times, and
in nineteen different jails. Nor were the jails
very pleasant places to be in. But sometimes
they turned even the prisons into places of joy
and prayer. There is just a smack of holy malice
in the story of one brother who tells how six
of them were imprisoned together for holding a
Baptist meeting. As soon as they were lodged
in jail, they used the government’s own house
and the government’s chairs to hold a glorious
Baptist protracted meeting that lasted for four
weeks.</p>

<p>Still these imprisonments are pleasanter to tell
about than to go through. They told on the
health of the brethren. Their property was seized
to pay fines. Their wives and little ones were left
unprotected. Their earnings ceased during the
imprisonment, and when they came out of prison
they often found their occupation gone. But the
men bred by those times were strong in the Lord,
nothing daunted by the adversary, conscious that
they were the soldiers of God, called, like Gideon,
to do battle with a handful, but with the Lord on
their side. Three men stand out as a kind of trio
of leaders during those early years, Oncken, Lehmann,
and Köbner. Mr. Oncken was thirty-four
years of age when he shared in that baptism by
night in the Elbe. God had taken him out of the
rationalistic religion of his own country when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
was nineteen years old, and had sent him to England.
He was converted there, and returned a few
years later as a missionary of the British Continental
Society. He labored most faithfully for
some years before he became a Baptist. He understood
the Scriptural doctrine of baptism several
years before he had the opportunity to follow
Christ in baptism. After that time, he pushed the
work with great executive ability and intense earnestness.
He was a leader of men. He did great
service to his brethren by his knowledge of English,
which enabled him to represent the cause in
Great Britain and also in the United States, and
to gain for it the financial and moral support of
England and America which has been so helpful
to the work. In 1879 he was paralyzed, and spent
the last years of his life in forced retirement in
Zürich. The active brain had become feeble. The
only thing which rekindled the old fire in the dying
embers was prayer and the words of the Bible.
He entertained his visitors by reciting, with evident
spiritual enjoyment, a verse from some familiar
hymn, and a few moments afterward he
would repeat it over again, forgetting what he had
just said. He died at the age of eighty-four, and
was buried with all honors at Hamburg, on the
eighth of January, 1884. His name will remain
the great name in the early history of the Baptists
of Germany.</p>

<p>Another of the men just mentioned was G. W.
Lehmann, born in 1799, an engraver and etcher by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
trade, and a missionary by divine vocation. He
was one of the first six baptised by Oncken, in
Berlin, in 1837. He believed in a special manner
in the power of the union of believers. He
organized; he drew the churches together in associations;
he constituted himself a link between
them by ceaseless itinerant missionary labor.
He died at Berlin in 1882. The writer met him
there shortly before his death. His powers, also,
had been broken by age. But his face was of
rare sweetness, and his prayers, though broken
and full of repetitions, still had the unction of
former days.</p>

<p>The third of this noble triumvirate was Julius
Köbner, born in 1807 in Denmark. He was a Jew
by birth. His father was a Chief Rabbi, and saw
to it that his son was instructed in all the learning
of the law. But the young man heard the message
of the crucified Messiah and believed. He
was baptised in 1830, and rendered valuable service
to the cause, both in Denmark and Germany.
He was not a man of action so much as of thought
and feeling. There was a mystic glow of love and
devotion in all he said. His poetic talent was of
a very high order. He has greatly enriched Baptist
hymnology. His chief work is a volume entitled
“Das Lied von Gott,” describing God’s creative
and redemptive work. It contains passages
of great power, and has been highly commended
by such literary authorities as Karl Gerok. His
last years were spent at Elberfeld and Berlin. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
had a little daughter born to him in old age. It
was very touching to see the old man with the
sweet oriental face looking down at the little maid
by his side as they took their walks together, each
anxious to lead and care for the other. He, too,
has now passed away. So has Claus Peters, who
was a kind of bishop in all the region of Schleswig;
so have Bues and Cramme. Others of the first
generation are now old. A new generation is
growing up to solve new problems. There are
many strong men among them, so many that it
might be invidious to single out any for special
mention. Those American travelers who have
sought out the German pastors in the places
where they stayed, have felt that they were amply
rewarded by the contact with these faithful men
of God.</p>

<p>The men of the older generation were called
directly from their trade to the ministry of the
Word. They were taught in the school of life,
and instructed by adversity. Attempts were
made years ago to train the preachers. They
were gathered by Oncken, or Köbner, or Berneike,
for a few months of teaching. In 1880, a
permanent school was established with seven
pupils, and the late Reverend Moritz Geissler as
professor. The school now has twenty-six students,
two instructors in the secular branches, and
two professors, J. G. Lehmann, a son of the older
Lehmann, and J. G. Fetzer, of Rochester Seminary.
The school has a four years’ course, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
an occasional partial course of one year for
older men. The students were for a long time
housed in very insufficient quarters near the
Hamburg church; but, in 1888, a handsome building
was erected in Horn, a suburb of Hamburg,
and the school is now well equipped and sure to
influence the future of the German Baptists.</p>

<p>The other great institution for the furtherance
of the work is the publishing house. The dissemination
of Christian literature has, from the
first, been one of the chief aims of our brethren.
At first, Mr. Oncken obtained grants of Bibles
and books from other societies; but the need of
having a publishing house under his own control
soon became apparent, and the first tract was
published in 1834. Through its connection with
American and British tract and Bible societies,
the society has been able to do an extensive
work. The number of Bibles and Testaments
sold during 1887 was 35,586 copies. Over three
million pages of tracts were issued during the
same year. A number of periodicals also issued
from the press of the society. Sunday-school
lesson papers are published. There is a paper
called “Wort und Werk” for the young men, and
another called “Tabea” for the young women.
The most important paper is the “Wahrheitszeuge,”
the regular organ of the denomination,
which has recently become a weekly, and has a
circulation of over five thousand copies. Since
1878, the business has been managed by Reverend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Philip Bickel, D. D., formerly editor of the “Sendbote”
at Cleveland, Ohio. He has, by the most
painstaking work, diminished the indebtedness
of the business, and steadily increased the scope
of its work. The colporteurs and volunteer workers
of the German Baptist churches constitute an
agency for the dissemination of Christian literature
which, for cheapness and effectiveness, is
scarcely equalled anywhere.</p>

<p>The work is bound to grow. It is opposed by
the conservatism and prejudice of the people, of
the strength of which no one can have a conception
who has not put his shoulder against it and
tried to budge it. The government, at least in
the larger states, has taken a far more tolerant
attitude; but complete religious liberty does not
exist in Germany, nor will it exist until the State
Churches have been disestablished, and the German
nation has stripped from its limbs the last
shackles of political absolutism and caste prerogative.
Our churches are increasing in number in
spite of the constant drain of emigration which
takes from them their most prosperous and wide-awake
members. But, aside from the actual gain
of converts, our churches are doing the work of
leavening thought by their literature, by their
demonstration of the power of Christian fellowship
as presented in a church of believers, and by
the very general and extensive system of lay
evangelization. In 1889, 190 churches reported
1409 stations where the Word is preached at regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
intervals. Our churches are the conductors
of the evangelical thought and church methods
of England and America. They have been pioneers
of Sunday-school work in Germany, and
they are bound to influence its entire religious
future.</p>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/cap-i.jpg" width="25" height="60" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi08">I BELIEVE it was Zeno who said, “We have
only one mouth, but two ears; whereby Nature
teaches us that we should speak little,
but hear much.” So, having two eyes and only
one pen, I must see much and write little. I shall
not therefore pause, as I should like, to speak of
a few charming days spent in walking through the
“Black Forests” of Germany, nor of a visit to
Heidelberg, beautiful for situation and famous
for its university,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Half hidden in a gallery of pines,<br />
Nestling on the sunny slope.”</p>

<p class="p1">There is no more impressive sight in Germany
than the ruins of the Heidelberg Castle. The remains
of its frowning battlements, ivy-covered
walls, and hanging gardens speak most eloquently
of its former greatness and grandeur. I can never
forget the moonlight nights that Johnson and I
spent in Heidelberg, wandering up and down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
banks of the Neckar, listening to the music of her
waters as they flow on to join the legendary Rhine,
a few hundred yards below.</p>

<p>Leaving Heidelberg at four o’clock in the morning,
we travel all day through a comparatively
uninteresting country, reaching Basle, Switzerland,
in time to break bread with a friend (?) who kindly
sent a committee to the depot to meet us. The
committee insisted on carrying us up from the
station in a carriage, but we told them that as we
had no exercise during the day, we preferred to
walk and carry our own satchels.</p>

<p>The day after arriving in Basle, we see a hundred
and twenty-five German and Swiss emigrants
starting for America. At the request of the
emigration agent, who was possessed of much
intelligence and good information, I make a speech
to the emigrants the hour before their departure.
I tell them not to stop around New York and
Boston, but to go West. After speaking briefly
of the advantages of the country, I tell them that
America is not an Eden, but a wilderness; not a
wilderness, either, where people are miraculously
fed with manna, as were the Israelites of old, but
one where the horny-handed sons of toil have to
dig their bread out of the ground; yet it is a wilderness
which, when watered by the sweat of the
brow, is transformed into a waving harvest field.
I tell them that we invite immigration, not that
we want foreigners to fill easy places and control
political affairs; that a few years ago there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
some men in Chicago, who went there with this
false idea in their brains, and, in trying to run the
government, they made a mistake and ran their
heads into a halter. I insist that earnest, honest,
persistent, and intelligent laborers are the kind
of men we want; that such men are protected
by law, and rewarded with a comfortable living.
After expressing the wish that they might be
freed from sea-sickness while crossing the ocean,
and from home-sickness after landing on the
other side, I bid them adieu.</p>

<p>A few days suffice to show us the parks, monuments,
and public buildings of the city. Among
the latter, is the time-honored cathedral in which
rest the bones of Erasmus, the scholar of the Reformation.</p>

<p>It was two hours after leaving Basle, before we
could realize that we were in Switzerland. Now,
however, a great mountain rose up before us. It
was too long to surround, and too high to surmount;
hence, we had either to stand still, retreat,
go under, or else go through the mountain. After
boring our way through the solid rock for two
miles, we come into the light on the opposite side.
We find that this tunnel is only a gateway admitting
us into the land of wonders, and to the heart
of the Alps, a description of which will occupy the
next chapter.</p>

<p>We are now wild with delight, running first to
one side of the car, and then to the other, to catch
a momentary glimpse of the mountains as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
dash by us. The snowy peaks now burst upon
our vision, and, just as Johnson is getting ready
to stand on his head, the brakesman shouts,
“Lucerne! All out for Lucerne!” This announcement,
of course, interrupts the proceedings of my
traveling companion; hence, leather does not “go
up,” as I expected.</p>

<p>We find Lucerne to be the general rendezvous
of thousands of tourists who, in the search of
health or pleasure, have come hither from Russia,
Turkey, Greece, Hungary, and Asia Minor, from
Germany, France, Italy, England and America.
Sometimes, at the evening hour the different
nationalities are represented in one room, and
there follows a Babel of confusion.</p>

<p>How beautiful and varied is the scene before
me at this hour! It is a lovely moonlight night,
and the lake shines bright and tranquil as a
polished mirror. The laughing stars lie buried
in the blue depths below. On the bosom of this
fairy lake are scores of lover-laden row boats,
shooting, turning, gliding, in every possible direction.
As the oars strike the water, they gleam in
the moonlight like paddles of silver. There are
two, four, or six persons in each boat. Several
boats have now grouped together, and all have
joined in singing “Moonlight on the Lake,” and
the soft music floats over the still waters until it
dies away in the distance. There is a momentary
pause. And now, just in front of the long line of
four-story hotels, which are set back about one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
hundred feet from the lake, the Hungarian Band
breaks forth and its wild melodies are echoed
from the surrounding hills. Next the Neapolitan
Quartette causes a perfect uproar of laughter as
it discourses the latest Italian comic songs with
banjo accompaniment. As the clock from the
cathedral tower announces the hour of eleven, a
change comes over the scene. The street lamps
are extinguished, and the good-humored multitude
pour forth their extravagant praises of the
brilliant display of fireworks which are now filling
the air with noise and showers of falling stars.
Thus do tourists and visitors spend their summer
evenings in this little town of Lucerne, this “Swiss
Lady of the Lake.”</p>

<p>All through the month of August, thunder-storms
of unusual grandeur have been prevalent
in Switzerland. Twenty-four hours ago, I witnessed
a thunder-storm that made a lasting impression.
It was twelve o’clock at night. The
evening before all nature was in confusion. The
angry clouds were like seething volcanoes, shooting
up their thunderheads as if they would strike
heaven in the face. Behind these cloud-battalions,
which were constantly forming and reforming
in ranks of war, the sun was skirmishing.
Now and then his fiery darts would pierce the
serrate columns, but immediately they would close
up the gap and shut out the sun. As if given up
in despair, he retired behind the western hills.
The world was then locked in the embrace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
night, and given over to the remorseless storm-god.
The angry clouds began to gather from
the east and west and north and south, growing
denser and darker as they came. Muttering
thunder could be heard in the distance. At last
the crisis came. One blinding flash of lightning
followed another. The lakes roared. The earth
moved. The mountains reeled! Thunder answered
thunder! Deep called unto deep! The peaks,
like mountain monarchs, seemed to be quarreling
with each other; each peak had a voice and each
glen an echo! One moment all was painfully
dark, and the next a mighty sheet of flame could
be seen falling from the clouds upon the mountain
tops. There it lingered for a moment, and then,
rolling itself into billows, it came dashing down
the rocky steeps like cataracts of fire, turning
night into day and revealing a hundred snow-capped
peaks around.</p>

<p class="drop-capi08">I HAVE been in Switzerland only a few days
before I take what the people here call the
Alpine fever. It affects my blood; it gets into
my very bones. I can feel it in every limb at
every breath. I consult no physician&mdash;I need
none. I know full well that the only cure for my
disease is to get out among the mountains and
there commune with Nature and Nature’s God.
I did not come to Switzerland to hear fine music,
or to be initiated into the mysteries of fashionable
hotel life. I came to enjoy the wild and rugged
scenery of the Alps. It seems, too, that it
takes more to satisfy me than it does most people.
They tell me they came here for the same
purpose that I did, and yet they are quite content
to remain in the cities and behold the mountains
afar off. Not so with me. The moment I behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the gleaming snow on the uplifted mountains, I
see that it is not a scarlet ensign indicative of
wrath, war, and bloodshed. No, the signal is
white, the flag of truce, the emblem of peace, of
innocence and purity. Hence, I am not repelled
but wonderfully drawn by the mountains. I can
but repeat the language that Schiller put into the
mouth of his Swiss hero, William Tell:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“There is a charm about them, that is certain&mdash;<br />
Seest thou yon mountains with their snowy peaks<br />
Melting into and mingling with the sky?”</p>

<p class="pn1">I think, too, of the wifely warning that Hedwige
gave Tell:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Thou never leav’st me but my heart grows cold<br />
And shrinks, as though each farewell were the last&mdash;<br />
I see thee midst the frozen wilderness,<br />
Missing, perchance, thy leap o’er some dark gulf,<br />
Or whirl’d down headlong with the struggling chamois;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“I see the avalanche close o’er thy head,<br />
The treacherous ice give way beneath thy feet&mdash;<br />
And thee&mdash;the victim of a living grave!<br />
Death, in a thousand varying shapes, waylays<br />
The Alpine traveler. ‘Tis a hazardous and fearful trade!”<br />
</p>

<p class="pn1">The husband’s reply was:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“He who trusts in God, and to those powers which God hath given him,<br />
May guard himself from almost every danger.<br />
These mountains have no terrors for their children.”</p>

<p>And I am for the time being a child of the Alps.
I have a mountaineer’s spirit in me, and I say:
“I will go!” The next thing is to secure an
Alpine outfit, which consists of spiked shoes, an
Alpenstock, an ice ax and a rope. These things
in our hands and neatly strapped on our backs,
Johnson and I leave the social haunts of men,
and start out to “do the Alps.” On the “Rainbow,”
we sail over Lake Lucerne from end to
end. We then walk to Fluelen and Altdorf,
where is laid the scene of Schiller’s immortal
play, “William Tell.” We see Tell’s statue, erected
on the spot where with crossbow he shot the
apple off his son Walter’s head. We visit the
place where during a raging storm, Tell sprang
from the boat upon a projecting rock, thereby
saving himself from the dungeon, and rescuing
Switzerland from the hands of tyranny. We
climb the Rigi, the mountain that gave Mark
Twain so much trouble. Standing upon its elevated
summit, we look down upon eleven silvery
lakes spread out in the valleys 5,000 feet below.
We now strike out over Brüning Pass for Brienz
and Interlaken. The most interesting object
during this delightful sail was the famous Griessbach
Falls. As the steamer approaches, all eyes
are fixed upon the rushing torrent whose foaming
waters, eager to escape from their mountain
prison, burst forth from the mountain side, and
leap from rock to rock until they mingle with the
placid lake 1,200 feet below!</p>

<p>Interlaken, as its name indicates, is between the
lakes, Brienz and Thun. This is not a city, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
small, characteristic Swiss village, hemmed in by
two lakes, and two mountains, whose precipitous
sides are feathered over with fir trees. Indeed,
the surroundings are so picturesque and beautiful
that we make Hotel de Nord headquarters for
several days, during which time we make several
delightful excursions on and around the lakes.
Our stay is made more pleasant because of the
company of L. Woodhull and J. A. Worthman,
of Dayton, Ohio; but theirs is a flying trip, hence
we are soon separated.</p>

<p>We now penetrate the very heart of the Alps.
We spend a month, and walk more than five
hundred miles, creeping through the windings of
the mountains; in following up streams to their
sources; in crossing narrow chasms whose yawning
depths even now make me dizzy when I think
of them; in climbing rugged peaks where one
false step would have dashed us against the jagged
rocks, two, three, and sometimes four, thousand
feet below; in letting ourselves down by
ropes into deep gorges on whose rocky floor ray
of sun or moonbeam has never fallen; in traversing
seas of ice or glacier fields, two of which, the
Rhone and the Aletsch glaciers, are the most
extensive in the Alps, being fifteen miles long
and from one to three miles wide.</p>

<p>Reader, stand with me for a moment upon the
banks of this Swiss river, and we shall find it
worthy of the world of savage grandeur through
which it passes. The river is quite narrow. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
rocky bed is full three hundred feet below the
banks on which we stand. The water dashes by
us with such force and velocity that, as it strikes
the rocks and bowlders in the stream, the spray
rises up for a hundred feet or more. The light
of the sun shining through the rising mist flings a
radiant rainbow on the opposite wall of rock.</p>

<p>Mountains rise up abruptly on either side of
the river. On the opposite side of the stream
from where we stand, a mountain rises up steeply
for six, eight, nine, thousand feet. Away up there
9,000 feet above the world, on the broad top of
the mountain, there is an everlasting lake filled
from Heaven’s founts, baring its blue bosom to
the blue sky. Around this “lake of the gods,”
and also from its centre, Alpine peaks lift their
grey and ghastly heads up against the sky, as if
to support the blue dome of Heaven, lest the
moon and the stars extinguish themselves in the
crystal sea. And that is not all. The water, as
if tired of its home in the skies, breaks over its
rocky prison walls; and, in a perpetual stream
eighteen inches deep and thirty feet wide, it
comes, churned into madness and foam&mdash;comes
madly dashing and splashing down the mountain
side for 9,000 feet at an angle of seventy-five
degrees. Finally with the swiftness of an arrow
the maddened stream leaps into the river, and we
stand on the banks and look down on the “hoarse
torrent’s foaming breath below.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“We gaze and turn away and know not where,<br />
Dazzled and drunk with beauty, till the heart<br />
Reels with its fullness, there&mdash;forever there&mdash;<br />
Chain’d to the chariot of Nature’s triumphal Art<br />
We stand as captives, and would not depart.”</p>

<p class="p1">Baedeker truly says: “The glacier&mdash;the most
striking feature of the Alpine world&mdash;is a stupendous
mass of purest azure ice.” No scene in
Switzerland is so strikingly and so strangely
beautiful as when, in some fertile and wooded
valley, the glittering pinnacles of a glacier are
suddenly presented to our gaze, in the immediate
proximity of wheat fields, fruit trees, smiling meadows
and human habitations. These extensive
glaciers are long arms of solid ice, resembling a
thousand frozen cataracts, occupying entire valleys,
and attaining a thickness estimated at 1,500
feet. The surface of these glaciers is by no means
smooth and regular. Here one frowning terrace
rises above another; there the glacier swells and
rises into huge pinnacles and towering pyramids
of purest ice. Again the surface is torn into
every conceivable shape by great crevasses which
sometimes sink to an enormous depth. In crossing
these glaciers, guides, spiked shoes, Alpenstocks,
strong ropes, and ice axes are indispensable.</p>

<p>The rope is tied around the waist of each
one of us, guides and all, leaving eight or ten feet
of rope between each two persons, one guide at
each end of the rope. Thus we, “with cautious
step and slow,” start across a sea of ice, all following
the foremost guide and stepping in his tracks.
Sometimes every foothold has to be cut with an
ax. Now we come to a deep crevasse into which
we are let down by a rope. Once safely down
the guide cuts our way in the ice until we gain
two ladders, one above the other, that have been
placed there for that purpose. Notwithstanding
one’s double suit of underclothing and heavy
wraps, he becomes so chilled and benumbed that
he gradually loses his native activity. Hence the
greatest caution is necessary to get back without
broken limbs. As one sees these pinnacles and
pyramids of purest azure ice bathed in the golden
splendor of the setting sun, their shining steps
look like a crystal stairway reaching from earth
to heaven. A glacier reflecting the sun’s evening
glories could perhaps not be better described
than by saying, it looks like heaven hung out
to air.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“There are things whose strong reality<br />
Outshines our fairy-land; in shape and hues<br />
More beautiful than our fantastic sky.”</p>

<p class="p1">We must now quit the glacier field, and go up
on the Aeggischhorn. Reader, you must know
that the way is long and rough and steep and
hard. But what man has done, man can do. The
object is worth the labor. What were a month’s
climbing, even though it be doubly difficult, when
it is to be rewarded with the prospect from
yonder imperial height? We cross chasm after
chasm, struggle from cliff to cliff, go from height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to height, until we stand 14,000 feet above the
world! Around us are a thousand snow-capped
peaks rising up until they “melt into and mingle
with the skies.”</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The sun seems pausing above the mountain’s brow<br />
As if he left reluctantly a scene so lovely now.”</p>

<p class="p1">The rays of light like arrows pierce the ice-covered
rocks, and set the Alpine world on fire.
The bended heavens not far above us blush to
behold the sight. Gods, isn’t it glorious! Slow
wanes the day from these sequestered valleys.
As the tourists watch the sun gather up his spent
shafts and put them back into his golden quiver,
they involuntarily take off their hats and contemplate
the “afterglow” in silence.</p>

<p>I might as well rest my pen, for I might write
until my hand would become palsied from use,
and you might read my writing until your eyes
would grow dim with age, and yet I could convey
to you no just conception of the Matterhorn
whose brow really seems ambitious of the skies!
nor yet of the majestic Jungfrau whose head goes
careering ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, thousand
feet towards heaven. It is noonday when I first
stand at the foot of the Jungfrau, the young wife.
The clouds have come down and settled upon
and around the mountain until at least half of it
is obscured from view. But my eyes are something
like daggers piercing the clouds through,
for I want to get a glimpse of the mountain as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
near to heaven as possible. All at once the
clouds begin to rise. They lift themselves clear
above the mountain’s brow. Ah, me! I have to
shut the door close on my fluttering, my rising,
soul, lest it pass outward and upward in astonishment.
This is the Jungfrau, vailed in her dazzling
shroud of eternal snow, and I am sure
Ruskin was correct when he said: “The seen
walls of lost Eden could not have been more
beautiful, or more awful round Heaven the gates
of sacred death.” Now, as if the mountain’s brow
was too sacred to be bared long at a time, the
clouds, like a mighty sheet, begin to unfold and
come down. The mountain is soon wrapt again
in thick clouds, but she lifts her ambitious head
aloft. Above and beyond the clouds her icy
crown glistens in the light of the sun.</p>

<p>The people here say this is the best place in
Switzerland to see an avalanche. I am determined
to see one, if I have to remain here all
summer. I see none the first day. As night approaches,
I cross a frightfully deep and yawning
chasm, and come over on the Wengernalp, 3,000
feet high, which leaves me still 13,000 feet below
the top of the Jungfrau. Next morning, about half-past
seven o’clock, I hear a strange noise, apparently
in Heaven, as though the angels had revolted.
The noise is in the direction of the Jungfrau,
whose head is still hidden in the clouds. The noise
is heard, but the cause is unseen. It seems that
a thousand cyclones and thunder-storms have combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
into one. It comes “nearer, clearer, deadlier”
than before. All eyes are turned in one direction,
and now we see a world of white snow
bursting forth like a thunderbolt from the bosom
of the clouds. It comes leaping down the mountain
side from crag to crag, from peak to peak,
across crack and glen and crevasse. Gathering
momentum with each successive leap, it sweeps
down the mountain side with such deafening noise
and terrific force that nothing on earth could stay
its onward progress. The earth trembles and the
mountains reel as it leaps into the yawning chasm
below.</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“These are the Alps,</p>
<p class="pp7">The palaces of Nature, whose vast walls<br />
Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,<br />
And throned Eternity in icy halls<br />
Of cold sublimity, where forms and falls<br />
The avalanche&mdash;the thunderbolt of snow!<br />
All that expands the spirit, yet appals,<br />

<p>After ascending Mount Blanc, I can but say, I
have scaled thy heights, I have sniffed thy breeze,
I have planted my feet upon thy glittering crown,
but who, oh who, can comprehend thy glory! Oh
thou monarch of mountains! I see thee in all thy
majesty. Thy proportions are so vast and gigantic,
thy form so regal and grand, that the eye in
vain attempts to estimate them. Distance is
annihilated by thy vastness, for thou art towering
above us as if thou wouldst bear thy burden of
virgin snow back to its native heaven. Yet above
thy regal brow I see an eagle. For a moment he
pauses with outstretched wings, as if to contemplate
thy glory, and then screaming with delight
and whirling himself in the air, he continues his
onward, upward flight, as if he would clutch his
talons in the fiery sun itself.</p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Wave, eagle, thy pinion<br />
Supreme in the air!”</p>

<p class="p1">But leave, ah leave, me alone on the mountain
top amidst the frozen wilderness. I love to roam
among the mountains. I love their pure air,
their jagged heights, their snowy peaks, and their
foaming cataracts tumbling down. Yea,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“For the lifting up of mountains,<br />
In brightness and in dread;<br />
For the peaks where snow and sunshine<br />
Alone have dared to tread;<br />
For the dark of silent gorges,<br />
Whence mighty cedars nod:<br />
For the majesty of mountains,<br />
I thank thee, O my God.”</p>

<p class="p1">This little country of Switzerland, locked in by
the Alps, and surrounded by Germany, France,
Italy, and Austria, boasts the oldest republic in
the world, its present form of government having
existed half a thousand years. It is inhabited
by 2,700,000 people, speaking three different languages.
One million and a half speak German,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
one million French, and the remainder Italian.
Unlike the people of other European nations,
four-fifths of these Switzers are land owners.
They love to sing</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“Home, sweet home,</p>
<p class="pp6">Be it ever so humble, there is no place like home!”</p>

<p class="pn1">And, verily, their homes are humble, especially
in the wilder parts of the country. Their rude,
structures are, for the most part, built of fir poles
and rough stones, and are often perched on the
steep mountain side, thousands of feet above the
valley. Sometimes nearly the whole house is
hidden away in a blasted rock, only the end facing
the valley being visible. These mountaineers
live high&mdash;I can not say <i>well</i>. They have elevated
thoughts, that is if they have any thoughts at
all; they look down upon kings and ordinary
mortals, and only look up to eagles and to God.
Despite the extraordinary precaution taken to
have their houses shielded by the rock, many of
them are annually swept away by avalanches. It
is difficult to trace out the dim and winding paths
by which these people reach their mountain huts.</p>

<p>I said most Switzers are land-owners, and so
they are, on a small scale. It is only a little here
and less there; an acre in one place, a half acre
in another, and so on. They have few or no
horses, but nearly every family has two or three
cows and a half dozen goats. They milk both
goats and cows; both are as gentle as cats, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
each one appears to know its name. Switzerland
is a great country for honey, cheese, vegetables
and fruit. Pears and grapes of the finest quality
everywhere abound. Wine is plentiful and almost
as cheap as water, though I do not take
advantage of the “reduced rates.”</p>

<p>There is something about the plain, simple,
and unpretentious ways of these Alpine folk that
challenges admiration. They are earnest, honest,
pious, truthful, and industrious. Indeed, they can
not be otherwise than industrious. Necessity is
their stern master. He treads upon their heels,
and cracks his whip over their heads. They have
no machinery&mdash;they want none. They know
nothing, and care less, about what progress the
world is making. To them, “the world” means
Switzerland, and that is about the same from age
to age. “Contentment is the price of happiness;”
they have paid the price, and enjoy the prize.
The iron-belted and thunder-riven mountains
have lent strength of character and force of will to
the men. They are hardy mountaineers. They
love their country next to their God.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“True as yon Alp to its own native flowers<br />
True as the torrent to its rocky bed,<br />
Or clouds and winds to their appointed track;<br />
The Switzer cleaves to his accustom’d freedom,<br />
Holds fast the rights and laws his fathers left him,<br />
And spurns the tyrant’s innovating sway.”</p>

<p class="p1">The crystal streams, silvery lakes, and smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
valleys, have reflected their beauty in many a
maiden’s face. True, these daughters of the
forest wear no high-heeled boots nor Paris bonnets,
but they are beautiful, nevertheless. I think
Johnson will not soon forget a girl whom we met
in a Swiss chalet where we stayed a few nights
ago. And who can blame him? She was eighteen
years of age, of medium height, and had a faultless
figure. She had a Grecian face, smooth
features, fair complexion, large brown eyes, and
flowing auburn hair. A radiant smile wreathed
her innocent face. She looked at Johnson. He
looked at her. Neither one spoke. Neither one
could speak so the other could understand. But
what is the use of words</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“When each warm wish springs mutual from the heart,<br />
And thought meets thought ere from the lips it part,<br />
When love is liberty, and nature law?”</p>

<p class="p1">That night Johnson came to our room claiming
that he was ill. When I inquired as to the nature
of his trouble, he said he did not know what it
was. He did not know whether he had the rash,
whooping-cough, measles, small-pox, or cholera;
but he had something, and had it bad. Whereupon
I applied a flaxseed poultice to the back of
his neck. Next morning found him convalescent,
though not entirely relieved. I see from history
that such occurrences were common in the middle
ages.</p>

<p>We have now been in Switzerland forty days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
It has been forty days of hard work, and yet forty
days of intense delight. We have walked nearly
six hundred miles, and the last mile was stepped
off with as much ease as the first mile. The last
step had in it the same elasticity and firmness as
the first. My youth was renewed like the eagle’s.
I constantly felt like mounting on the wings of
rejoicing, and gliding over the country as a disembodied
spirit.</p>

<p>In some places, the angles we made in ascending
and descending were not less than sixty to
seventy-five degrees! One time, when nightfall
came, I was thoroughly tired&mdash;completely exhausted.
Pain trembled in every limb. My knees
denied their office. Hearty supper, warm footbath,
bed, oblivion! Strange as it may appear,
the next day was spent, not in walking but in
reading history.</p>

<p>In our Alpine experiences, we walked from
Switzerland into France and back again; over
Napoleon’s famous Alpine pass from Switzerland
into Italy and back. One time, while crossing
the Alps without a guide, we lost our way. For
several hours we wandered around&mdash;we knew not
whither. All at once the clouds dropped down
upon us, and with the clouds there came a blinding
snow-storm. It seemed as if we would freeze.
I knew we could not survive the cold till morning.
I thought, “Is it possible that this white snow is
to be my winding-sheet, and some rocky chasm
my lonely grave?” Just before dark, our hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
were gladdened by the sight of six men not far
away. We called to them. Across the fields of
snow, the cold wind brought their cheering reply.
The men, clad in fur and wrapped in black gowns,
proved to be Augustine monks, who keep the St.
Bernard Hospice. They took us with them to
the Hospice which was only two miles away. On
reaching there, Johnson and I were almost frozen.
We were soon seated by a glowing fire, and were
comfortably shielded from the cutting wind and
falling snow during that memorable night above
the clouds.</p>

         alt=""
         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">HOSPICE IN THE ALPS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>We spent some time with the monks of the
Hospice. This noble institution has been standing
nearly a thousand years. It is in the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of the mountains&mdash;the highest winter habitation
in the Alps. Snow falls here nine months in the
year. The Hospice is kept by eighteen or twenty
Augustine monks, whose sole business is to search
for, assist and rescue, Alpine travelers who have
lost their way in the snow. We saw here about
a dozen of the famous St. Bernard dogs. They
are, by all odds, the largest and finest dogs I have
seen. They are thoroughly trained to assist the
monks in their work. In the morning, when they
are let out of the house where they have been
locked during the night, the dogs seem wild with
delight. They go bounding through the snow in
every direction. With fore feet on some huge
bowlder, and heads high in the air, they sniff the
cold mountain breeze, and off they go again.
For miles around, they search the mountains for
travelers who, on account of cold and snow, have
fallen by the wayside. In this way these philanthropic
monks and their noble dogs have saved
many lives.</p>

<p>It is impossible at the Hospice to dig graves in
the rock and snow and ice, so they have a “dead
house” where the bodies which are found in the
snow are placed and kept. The atmosphere is so
pure and intensely cold that decomposition takes
place very slowly. There are about fifty bodies
in the dead house now, the last two having been
placed there about eighteen months ago. I went
into this house, and I really believe that if I had
ever known the two persons last placed there, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
could have recognized them then. Any traveler
is kindly received by the monks and entertained
for the night without any charge. Each visitor
is expected, however, to “drop something in the
box.” Napoleon once stopped here, and hundreds
of his soldiers, as they passed over the mountains
with the cannon, partook of the hospitality of the
monks. Afterwards, the great Frenchman sent
one of his generals here to be buried, that he
might have the Alps as a monument.</p>

<p>I visited the prison of Chillon. It is a gloomy
old castle with five great towers, built upon a
rock projecting some two hundred yards into
Lake Geneva. Byron says of it:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Chillon! thy prison is a holy place,<br />
And thy sad floor an altar; for ’twas trod<br />
Until his very steps have left a trace,<br />
Worn, as if thy cold pavement were a sod,<br />
By Bonnivard! May none those marks efface,</p>
<p class="pp6q">“For they appeal from tyranny to God.<br />
There are seven pillars of Gothic mould<br />
In Chillon’s dungeon deep and old,<br />
And in each pillar there is a ring,<br />
And in each ring there is a chain.”</p>

<p class="pn1">The description is perfect. The whole thing is
there as of old.</p>

<p>I must stay my weary hand. I have already
perhaps, written too much about Switzerland.
But I have no apology to offer. I am in love
with the country, that’s all. Love Switzerland?</p>

<p>
“Who could help it that has a heart to love,<br />
And in that heart courage to make its love known?”<br />

<p class="pch">BAPTISTS IN FRANCE.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/cap-i.jpg" width="25" height="60" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi10">IN the early part of this century two English
Baptists began to preach the Gospel in Switzerland
and France. The burden of their
preaching was free salvation through faith in
Jesus Christ, and to their joy something of a religious
revival began to manifest itself. It seems
however, that these brethren did not give Believer’s
Baptism its proper place, and hence many of
their disciples, looking upon it as a matter of no
special importance, for the sake of peace kept it
constantly in the background. The result was,
that though many were converted and gathered
into churches through the labors of these good
Baptist brethren and their disciples, in 1830 only
two little churches in the northern part of France
were willing to be known as Baptists.</p>

<p>About this time Prof. Rostan of Marseilles,
left his home for the United States, where he became
a Baptist. In 1832 he returned to France
under the auspices of the Missionary Union, intending
to spend his life in preaching the Gospel
to his own people. He opened a hall in Paris,
and a goodly number of attentive and serious
hearers gathered about him, some of whom often
accompanied him to his home to receive further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
instruction. Mr. Rostan also sought interviews
with prominent and influential men, to explain to
them the object of his mission. He was generally
well received, and was invited to give a series of
lectures on Christianity before the “Society for
Promoting Civilization.” Being pious, cultivated
and zealous, there was every reason to hope that
he would accomplish a great work, but his lamented
death in December 1833 put an end to his
earthly labors.</p>

<p>The Missionary Union at once sent out an
appeal to young ministers, and Mr. Isaac Willmarth,
then of the Newton Theological Seminary,
who loved France, and especially Paris, because
there, while a medical student he was led to
Christ, presented himself, and was at once appointed
to carry on the work. He reached Paris
in June 1834. The following year a small church
was organized and soon after two theological
students were received into the church, and placed
themselves under Mr. Willmarth’s instructions.
Through a Colporteur whom he knew in Paris,
Mr. Willmarth was brought into relation with the
few Baptists of Northern France, who were much
gratified at receiving a visit from the American
Missionary, and who were not a little surprised to
hear from him of the large number of Christians
in America, who not only held to Believers’ Baptism,
but, as a result of this, to restricted Communion
also.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1835 the mission was reinforced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
by two other American Missionaries, Rev. E.
Willard, and Rev. D. N. Sheldon, both of Newton
Theological Seminary. The chief object of this
reinforcement was the establishment of a mission
school, with special reference to the training of
candidates for the ministry. Mr. Sheldon remained
in Paris and in June 1836, Mr. Willmarth
and Mr. Willard, wishing to be near the few Baptists
of Northern France, removed to Douai, a
town near the borders of Belgium, having a population
of twenty thousand, and containing a small
Baptist church. The following year Mr. Willmarth,
on account of failing health, found it necessary
to return to the United States, and two
years later Mr. Sheldon returned also. Mr. Willard,
left alone in France, continued his labors,
giving special attention to training of young men
for the ministry, in which work he was very successful.</p>

<p>In 1840 the mission numbered seven churches,
five out-stations, six ordained ministers, five assistants
and about two hundred members.</p>

<p>The period between 1840 and 1848 was one of
trial and persecution, the chief difficulties resulting
from the opposition of the government, which
made it unlawful for more than twenty persons to
meet together for any purpose, without the written
permission of the magistrates. Brethren began
holding private meetings in their own houses,
but very soon a law was enacted subjecting any
person who opened his house for public worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to a fine of from sixteen to three hundred francs.
The execution of these laws was committed to
the mayors of the communes, who were generally
Roman Catholics, and thoroughly under the influence
of the priests, who, as ever, were not slow
to avail themselves of this opportunity to persecute
these Baptist brethren, with the hope of preventing
further progress, and of destroying what
had already been accomplished. In several places
chapels were closed, one remaining unopened for
thirteen years, and consequently brethren were
forced to meet together secretly in private houses,
or in the quiet woods. But it was not without
danger that they thus assembled, for Preachers
and Colporteurs were often arrested and fined,
and but for the liberality of some good Baptists
of New York, who willingly paid these fines in
order that these faithful and courageous disciples
might go forth from prison to preach the Gospel,
their work would have been greatly hindered.</p>

<p>In 1847 a famous trial took place. The pastors
of Chauny and La fere (Aisne) together with a
Colporteur, were sentenced each to pay a fine of
three hundred francs, having been found guilty of
the crime of preaching the Gospel. Many of their
hearers were also subjected to fines. The case
was carried to a higher court, and the sentence
was somewhat modified. But feeling the injustice
and illegality of the sentence, even in its modified
form, it being a direct violation of the French
Code, adopted in 1830, which contained a definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
provision for freedom of worship for all religious
denominations, an appeal was made to the highest
court in the Empire. However, before the
final trial, the Revolution of February 1848, overthrew
the throne, and religious liberty was proclaimed
throughout the whole of France.</p>

<p>One of the chief obstacles being removed, the
work was prosecuted with lively hope and fresh
zeal, and the following year, 1849, proved a season
of special blessing, forty-five baptisms having
been reported. In 1850, the Baptist church in
Paris was re-organized with four members, the
first pastor being Mr. Dez. For thirteen years
the church worshipped in a small inconvenient
room, during which time the number of members
increased from four to eighty-four. A better
room was then obtained, where the brethren continued
to meet till 1873, when the present marble-front
chapel was provided. Work was carried on
successfully in several of the large towns of northern
France, and in the villages and the country
immediately adjoining them. The members of
the churches are generally poor, and often much
scattered, but they are most faithful and regular
in their attendance on the Sunday services, some
of them walking even ten miles. From all accounts
French Baptists are noted for their piety
and self-sacrificing efforts in spreading a knowledge
of the Truth.</p>

<p>Since 1857, when Mr. Willard returned to the
United States, the work has been under the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of a committee of French ministers, the
means being largely furnished by the Missionary
Union. The cause has made constant and substantial
progress, and gives good promise for the
future. A Theological School has been established
in Paris. Besides the chapel in Paris, several
others have been provided. The services are
generally well attended, and the people seem to
manifest a growing tendency and desire to hear
the Truth. In Chauny, where persecution was
once so rife, the chapel has been enlarged, in
order to accommodate the growing numbers who
wish to hear the Gospel. Baptisms are of frequent
occurrence. The little periodical called
“<i>L’Echo de la Verite</i>” has met with unexpected
favor and success, the number of its subscribers
being nearly twice that of the Baptists themselves.
A small but valuable Baptist literature has been
provided. If we include those not connected
with the Missionary Union, the Baptist force of
France numbers at present about twenty pastors
and evangelists, about twenty organized churches,
some forty or fifty sub-stations, and about one
thousand members. During these sixty years of
effort and suffering much precious fruit has been
gathered for the heavenly garner, and a good
foundation has been laid. Religiously, France
and Italy are very much alike, and the difficulties
of the one, are, in the main, the difficulties of the
other. In each case Romanism, with its attendant
and inevitable evils, is the chief obstacle. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the darkness of Romanism is sure to recede before
the light of God’s Word, and we may confidently
hope that the land so often crimsoned by
the blood of martyrs, the land of the Huguenots
will yet throw off the shackles of the “Man of Sin”
and bow to the sway of Immanuel.</p>

<p class="drop-capi08">I AM now far out on the Black Sea. Night has
settled down on the face of the deep, and
darkness broods over the wide, wide world.
This is, however, far from being a “still and pulseless
world” at present. We are not having a storm,
but the wind is blowing a perfect gale. I have
just been pacing the deck and watching the heaving
bosom of the ocean. I love the ocean; I love
its vastness; I love its doleful music; I love its
foam-crested waves and white-capped billows.
But I had to leave the deck to-night; it is too
cold and rough and dark to remain out any longer.
Hence I came to the saloon; and, as there are a
few thoughts floating through my mind, I take up
my pen. I am tired, and would wait until morning;
but memory is a treacherous creature, and the
only way I can secure these thoughts is to fasten
them in words, and chain them in writing. The
thoughts I propose to manacle pertain to places
I have visited and objects I have seen since leaving
Geneva, Switzerland. During this time, I have
traveled more than two thousand miles, sometimes
on foot, sometimes on trains, and sometimes on

<p>Vienna, the proud capital of haughty Austria,
has more than a million inhabitants, is splendidly
situated, and is one of the prettiest cities in
Europe. The city abounds in monuments and
statues, in large parks, lovely flower gardens, and
playing fountains. But Vienna’s crowning glory
is her superb architecture. The Emperor’s Mansion,
the Palace of Justice, and the Houses of
Parliament, are especially fine. They are immense
structures, and are elaborately sculptured not only
from the ground to the roof, but the roof itself is
covered with sculptured work. For instance, there
are standing on the House of Parliament alone,
eighty life-size marble statues. In addition to
these, there are, on the same roof eight large gilded
chariots, each drawn by four flying horses, and
driven by a winged goddess. As one approaches
these buildings, they present a most striking
appearance.</p>

<p>I went through the Palace, and saw the Emperor
and the crown jewels of Austria; through the
royal riding-school, where the imperial family are
daily instructed in the art of horsemanship;
through the art galleries and Museum, which contain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
too many fine pictures and objects of interest
to be mentioned here.</p>

<p>Since leaving Vienna, I have traveled through
Hungary, Servia, Slavonia, and Bulgaria, stopping
at Buda-Pesth, Belgrade, Rustchuk, and Varna.
For two days and nights I was on the majestic
Danube. Most of the time the river was broad,
and the country level and uninteresting. But this
was by no means uniform; occasionally the river
would burst through a rocky mountain ridge, and
I remember I opened my umbrella and stood on
deck in the cold wind and rain for three hours,
rather than go down to the saloon, where I could
only half see the rugged cliffs and peaks overhanging
the river. Do you say, “That was expensive
pleasure?” Well, be it so. But I love
nature. Besides, it has been said, and truly, I believe,
that we enjoy everything in proportion to
what it costs us. I am going to make a strong
statement, and yet one that is as true as strong.
I know that it will sound like blasphemy to some,
but I believe in the old proverb, “Honor to whom
honor is due;” hence I now declare that the
scenery along some parts of the Danube is finer
than anything on the Rhine.</p>

<p>The principal productions of Servia, Slavonia,
Roumelia, and Bulgaria, seem to me to be ignorance,
turnips, soldiers, poodle dogs, and an annual
crop of semi-royal, throne-seeking dudes. I would
rather own a thousand acres of black land in
Texas, or be a well-to-do farmer in Blue Grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Kentucky, than to have ten such thrones as all
these petty kingdoms combined could offer. I
settled the Bulgarian trouble, and left the country.
(I close for the night).</p>

<p>I fell asleep last night little dreaming what the
morning held in store for me. About 7 o’clock,
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, though I was up long before that time, we
entered the Bosphorus. We were sailing directly
towards the rising sun. Along the eastern horizon
great banks of purple clouds lay piled one
upon another like Pelion upon Ossa. The clouds
rise higher and higher, as now and then the sun
climbs up to peep over, like an imprisoned giant
from behind the frowning battlements.</p>

<p>We were apparently between the two arms of a
great horseshoe, and were gliding slowly on into
its curve, with the land on all sides sloping up
gently from the water’s edge. We were between
two continents&mdash;Europe on the right, and Asia
on the left. Our narrow passage was lined on
either side with great torpedo boats, and ironclad
men-of-war, trembling for service. These, in
turn, were flanked by two lines of impregnable
forts, planted with grim and frowning cannon. As
we pass the batteries and enter the bay, we behold
the great city of Constantinople, crowning
the heights that sweep around the curve of the
horseshoe. We see its palaces, mosques, towers,
and spires, all outlined against a dark background
of cloud. Just at this moment, the sun rifts the
purple clouds, and pours a flood of golden glory
over the whole scene.</p>

<p>By this time the “Urano” casts anchor, and we
are soon surrounded by two or three hundred
row-boats that have come to take the passengers
ashore. Just as I am about to step on shore an
armed soldier cries out: “Halt, stand!” I do not
know what the reader would have done, but I&mdash;well,
I obey the gruff voice. I am informed that
no man is allowed to set foot on Ottoman soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
without legal papers from his native country.
Whereupon, I draw from my pocket a passport.
The officer admires the American eagle, but has
some difficulty in reading the document. When
he comes to “<i>E pluribus Unum</i>” he stalls; and,
turning to me, he asks: “What does this mean?”
I reply: “That simply indicates my high rank and
official position at home. It says I am <i>one among
many</i>.” The Turk now uncovers his head, shows
his teeth, and bows.</p>

<p>I can say to-day, more truly than ever before,
“I am a stranger in a strange land.” I have just
been out in the city. The streets are crowded.
I saw Turks, Greeks, Jews, Americans, Russians,
Bulgarians, and Slavonians, all speaking strange
languages, all wearing different, strange, and grotesque
costumes, all looking and staring at me as
though I was some wild animal in Barnum’s show.
Nothing can be more strangely hideous than a
tall, stoop-shouldered, long-haired, black-eyed, copper-colored
Ottoman in his native dress, if dress
it may be called. The women go with their faces
veiled, their eyes being “too pure” to look upon
“Christian dogs,” as they call us.</p>

<p>It is Friday, the Mohammedan Sabbath, so I
went at noon to-day to the “Imperial Mosque” to
see the Sultan as he entered to say his prayers.
And I saw the Sultan, the man who is the husband
of 500 wives, the political ruler of the Turkish
Empire, and the spiritual head of the Mohammedan
world. The ceremonies attending the Sultan’s
parade to the Mosque were conducted
with an Oriental splendor that was simply dazzling
to human sight. Twenty thousand armed
soldiers&mdash;horse and foot&mdash;lined the way and surrounded
the Mosque. The soldiers all wore red
caps, and they looked like a veritable sea of blood,
on which were floating thousands of gleaming
bayonets and glistening sabres. The Sultan’s
approach was announced by blowing bugles, playing
bands, beating drums, and booming cannons.
As the Sultan&mdash;I had almost said as the Satan&mdash;passed,
the heathen people shouted: “Kalif, Humkiar,”
“Zil-Ulla,” “Alem Penah,” which being interpreted
means, “The successor of the Prophet,”
“Vicar of God, shadow of God,” “Refuge of the
world.” When I saw and heard these things, I
said to myself: “I would rather be an ass&mdash;crazy,
crippled, blind, and dumb&mdash;doomed to serve in a
tread-mill for a thousand years, than to be a two-legged
mass of putrefaction, and yet adored as a
god by an ignorant and corrupt heathen people.”</p>

ancient Troy, the city of Priam. Here, too, are

at anchor. There, also, is the island of Tenedos,
where the treacherous Greeks concealed themselves
when they pretended to abandon the siege
of Troy. The ghost of Virgil’s wooden horse

naval officer, standing by my side, this sentence

<p>It was here that a vision appeared unto Paul
by night. “There stood a man of Macedonia and
prayed him, saying, ‘Come over into Macedonia
and help us.’ Therefore loosing from Troas
(Troy), we came with a straight course to Samothracia,
and next day to Neapolis, and from there
to Philippi.” Then followed the imprisonment,
earthquake, etc. (Acts XVI). We are sailing
close along the coast of Macedonia, but Philippi
is not visible. We have a delightful day on the
Archipelago, and about eight o’clock on the second
morning we land at Piraeus. Here we take train,
and twenty minutes later we are in Athens. Here
the newsboys crowd around with Greek papers to
sell. The bootblacks speak Greek, hotel porters
speak Greek, the streets are named in Greek&mdash;everything
is Greek. I am in a new world, and
the trouble is that the Greek of to-day is so very
different from that used by the classic writers,
that my knowledge of the language helps me
but little.</p>

city.” Where do I go? I care little for the present
museums and art galleries, and still less for
King George, his Palace and the Royal Park. I
came here not to see modern Athens, but that
city</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“On the Aegean shore,</p>
<p class="pp6">Built nobly; pure the air and light the soil,<br />

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">THE PARTHENON OF THE ACROPOLIS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Hence I go at once to the famous Acropolis.
The Acropolis is a hill, or a great rock three hundred
feet high, jutting out of the valley in which
Athens is situated. This rock is oblong in shape,
measuring 1,100 feet north and south, and about 500
feet east and west. Its sides are everywhere steep,
and on the north perpendicular. This Athenian
rock, the Acropolis, was once crowned by five
marble temples, the most splendid of which was
the Parthenon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The Parthenon has justly been
called “the finest edifice on the finest site in the
world, hallowed by the noblest recollections that
can stimulate the human heart.” This wonderful
temple was 100 by 250 feet, built of the purest
Pentelic marble, and surrounded by eighty huge
columns. The Parthenon, like most of the other
Grecian temples, is now partly in ruins. It has
been standing twenty-five hundred years, and yet,
despite the combined onslaught and united ravages
of the Persian, the Turk, time, war, earthquake,
flood and fire, these stately walls and lofty
columns still stand to attest the energy, taste,
skill and culture of the ancient Greeks. They
were</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“First in the race that led to glory’s goal,</p>
<p class="pp8">The Parthenon, the Parthenon!</p>
<p class="pp6">Look on its broken Arch, its ruined wall,<br />
Its chambers desolate and portals foul.<br />
Yes; this was once ambition’s airy hall;<br />
The dome of thought, the palace of the soul.”</p>

<p class="p1">Standing on the Acropolis and looking toward
the north, I see modern Athens, with its seventy-five
thousand inhabitants. To the east, are the
remains of the “Temple of Jupiter.” This immense
structure was once surrounded by one
hundred and fifty Corinthian columns, seven feet
in diameter and sixty feet high. Sixteen of these
columns, and one triumphal arch, still stand in a
perfect state of preservation. They are wonderful
to behold.</p>

<p>Looking in the same direction, but beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the temple of Jupiter, I see the Stadium, which
consists of a natural amphitheatre, formed by
three hills, united and modified artificially. This
is where the gymnastic contests and Olympic
games took place.</p>

<p>Southwest of the Acropolis, is the rock-hewn
prison of Socrates where the grand old philosopher
drank the fatal hemlock. Directly west, is
the platform with a stone pulpit from which the
destinies of Athens were swayed by the matchless
eloquence of Demosthenes. Between this pulpit
and the Acropolis is the Areopagus, or Mar’s Hill.
When Paul was in Athens, “they took him and
brought him to the Areopagus, saying, ‘May we
know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest,
is?’ Then Paul stood in the midst of Mar’s
Hill and said, ‘Ye men of Athens, I perceive that
in all things ye are too superstitious. For, as I
passed by and beheld your devotions, I found
an altar with this inscription: ‘To the Unknown
God.’ Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly worship,
Him declare I unto you.’” (Acts xvii: 15-32.) I
stood “in the midst of Mar’s Hill,” and read Paul’s
speech in Greek to some “men of Athens,” who,
in all probability, had never heard it before.</p>

<p>I have now been in this classic land many days,
during which I have lost no time. I have seen
much of the people. On Tuesday and Saturday
afternoons of each week, the royal band discourses
music from a grand stand occupying the centre of
one of the public squares. During these concert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
hours, from five to ten thousand Greeks assemble
in this open square. Here they meet and mix and
commingle and commune in the freest and easiest
manner imaginable. They sit, stand, promenade,
or dance, as they like, but all of them are all the
time laughing and talking. I never saw a better-natured
crowd. I miss no opportunity like this
to study Greek life and character. One cannot
be thrown among this crowd for an hour without
observing among the women the same traits of
female beauty that we have been studying all our
lives in models of art and sculpture. The men, I
take it, have degenerated more than the women.
A modern Diogenes might walk the streets of
Athens for a week, <i>without finding a man</i> like
those of olden times. I am glad to add, however,
that the present king is doing much to elevate his
subjects.</p>

<p>I have wandered through and around these majestic
ruins all day, and then gone back at night
and viewed them by the pale moonlight. As I
sit in the quiet stillness of this midnight hour and
think of the past,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Memory approaches,</p>
<p class="pp7">Holding up her magic glass,</p>
<p class="pp6q">Pointing to familiar pictures,</p>
<p class="pp7">Which across the surface pass.”</p>

<p class="pn1">In the stately procession which sweeps across the
stage of my imagination, I see Socrates, Zeno,
Plato, and Xenophon; I see Aristotle, Solon, Pericles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Sophocles, and Demosthenes. These are
the men that gave Greece her glory; these are the
men who, with the fulcrum of thought planted
their feet upon the Acropolis and moved the
world. Borrowing the thought from Canon Farrar,
though not using his exact language, I may
say, “Under Greek influence human freedom put
forth its most splendid power; human intellect
displayed its utmost sublimity and grace; art
reached its most consummate perfection; poetry
uttered alike its sweetest and sublimest strains
and philosophy attuned to the most perfect music
of human expression, its loftiest and deepest
thought. Had it been possible for the world, by
its own wisdom, to know God; had it been in the
power of man to turn into bread the stones of the
wilderness; had perfect happiness lain within the
grasp of sense, or been among the rewards of culture;
had it been granted to man’s unaided power
to win salvation by the gifts and graces of his
own nature, and make for himself a new Paradise
in lieu of that lost Eden before whose gates still
wars the fiery sword of the Cherubim,&mdash;then such
ends would have been achieved by these old
Athenians. Nor did their influence die with their
bodies; it is alive to-day, and it will be transmitted
from generation to generation, until the stars
grow dim and moons shall wax and wane no
more.”</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi12">SMYRNA is the most important city in Asia
Minor, and one of the principal commercial
points of the Ottoman Empire. I am told that
the annual exports and imports amount to more
than $15,000,000. The population of the city is
estimated at 200,000, representing seven different
nationalities and speaking, therefore, seven separate
and distinct languages. From appearances,
one would judge that the city was built soon after
the flood, and that it had seldom been repaired.
The houses are old and dilapidated, the streets
are narrow, crooked and filthy. The people generally
are ignorant, superstitious and fanatical,
and wear various strange and grotesque costumes.</p>

<p>I have often heard that Smyrna was noted for
her pretty women, but I protest. I have seen
nothing in this city that even approximates female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
beauty; and, if I see a pretty woman at all, her
face is so completely covered and wrapped up in
muslins and shawls that I can hardly tell whether
she is a Greek or an Ethiopian.</p>

<p>One of the seven Asiatic churches was located
in this place. An old, old rock church still stands,
and is pointed out as the one in which the Apostles
used to preach. Near by the church is the
tomb of Polycarp, who was a pupil of the Apostle
John, and who was martyred A. D. 160, because
he preached “the Gospel of Christ.” I have often
read the touching account of Polycarp’s martyrdom.
When asked to recant, he replied: “For
eighty and six years have I served my God, and
He has never forsaken me; and I can not now
forsake Him.” The green boughs of a lone olive
tree wave above his tomb, and I say to my friend:
“Verily that tree is emblematic; its leaves are
green, so is the memory of Polycarp still fresh in
the mind of the Christian world. Above his tomb
waves the olive branch of peace; and his sainted
spirit, I believe, has gone on and up, and has long
been in the full enjoyment of ‘that peace which
the world knows not of.’”</p>

<p>From Smyrna I go out into the interior of the
country, which generally is neglected and barren.
I believe, however, that if the Turkish government
was struck by lightning, and some other power
could come in, that would encourage and protect
honest labor, these fertile valleys would again
yield abundant harvests, and that peace and plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
would reign where discord and pinching poverty
now hold sway. In my opinion, the Turkish government
is a reproach to the civilization of the
nineteenth century; and I think the Lord lets it
stand simply to show the powers of earth how
deep down into degradation and despair, into vice
and vagrancy, a nation can sink, when it wanders
away from and forgets God. “Sin is a reproach
to any people.”</p>

<p>On the way to Ephesus we meet several caravans,
or trains of camels. These “ships of the
desert” are all heavily laden, some with fruit,
dried figs, dates, pomegranates, others with hand-made
silks, Turkish rugs, Russian carpets, and
other fancy goods. These caravans go back and
forth between Smyrna and the far interior of the
country. Camels are very obedient, and it is
really amusing to see the humble creatures kneel
down to receive their burdens.</p>

<p>Ephesus is chiefly interesting because of its historical
associations. Next to Athens, it was once
the most magnificent city in the world. Ephesus
is as old as the hills. It is the birthplace of
mythology. Apollo and Diana were born here.
Bacchus and Hercules once struggled with the
Amazon in the streets of Ephesus. These hills
were once covered with twenty-five marble temples
dedicated to heathen gods, that of Diana
being one of the seven wonders of the ancient
world. Ephesus is one of the nine cities which
claim to have given birth to Homer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

         title="" />
     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">TURKISH LADY.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the greatest names in history are
connected with Ephesus. Alexander the Great
visited here; so did Hannibal and Antiochus
Scipio, Scylla, Brutus, Cassius, Pompey, Cicero,
and Augustus. Antony was once judge of the
court of Ephesus. It was from here that Antony
and Cleopatra sailed for Samos in gilded galleys
with perfumed silken sails and silver oars, drawn
by beautiful girls whose gleaming paddles kept
time to soft strains of music.</p>

<p>Some time ago, a very strange and serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
difficulty occurred in this city of Ephesus. The
trouble arose in this fashion: A stranger came
into the city. The new-comer was possessed of a
strong character and a superior education. He
was by birth a Jew, by nature a gentleman, by
education a scholar, by faith a Christian, and by
profession a Baptist preacher. According to his
custom, this strange Baptist preacher entered
into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
From what I can find out, this man made a favorable
impression in Ephesus, for the Jews “desired
him to tarry longer with them,” but “he consented
not.” He promised, however, to “return to them,
if it be God’s will.” The Lord kindly permitted
this man to return to Ephesus; and when he got
there he found “certain disciples.” He asked
them if they had received the Holy Ghost. They
replied: “We have not so much as heard whether
there be any Holy Spirit.” Strange to say, I
have heard professing Christians in America say
the self-same thing. These Ephesians, be it said
to their credit, acted wisely and were re-baptised.
The preacher then went into the church and
spoke boldly for the space of three months.
Now there arose a disturbance in the church, or
synagogue, as it was called, so that it became
necessary for the preacher to change the place of
meeting to the school-house, or college chapel.
Here, in this school-room, he held one of the
most wonderful protracted meetings I have ever
heard of; it lasted two years and three months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
“so mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.”
The town was stirred to its very depths. Among
the converts were many infidels, diviners, soothsayers,
fortune-tellers, etc. These people who
“used curious arts brought their books together
and burned them before all their fellow-townsmen;
and they counted the price of them, and found it
fifty thousand pieces of silver,” equal in American
money to $15,000. This was the grandest day in
the long history of Ephesus.</p>

<p>At this juncture, the silversmiths, who made
shrines for the Temple of Diana, and the other
heathen temples of Ephesus, came together and
decided that something had to be done to break
up the protracted meeting. They said that if
Christ continued to be preached, and Christianity
to spread, men would cease to bow down to
shrines, to stocks and stones, and then their craft
would be gone and the temple of “Diana despised.”
Then the excitement became intense, “The
whole city was filled with confusion.” Some,
therefore, cried one thing, and some another.
For two hours all with one voice shouted: “Great
is Diana of the Ephesians.”</p>

<p>For the benefit of those who have so much
business to attend to, or who have so many newspapers
to read, that they habitually neglect the
the Bible, I will add in conclusion that the Baptist
preacher who conducted this revival was Paul,
the Apostle (Acts xviii and xix). According
to tradition, the same Apostle was imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
here, and the cell in which he is said to have been
confined is still pointed out.</p>

<p>The church at Ephesus is the first one mentioned
in Revelation (ii: 1-8). John is believed
to have retired to Ephesus after his release from
banishment to Patmos, and thither the Virgin
Mary came to reside with the beloved disciple.
Here, says tradition, both of them died and were
buried. Their tombs are still shown to the traveler;
so, also, is the tomb of Timothy. Near by
these graves is the celebrated Cave of the Seven
Sleepers.</p>

<p>This once fair and populous city is now nothing
more than a lonely, desolate, bleak, and barren
heap of ruins. By the remaining aqueducts,
foundation stones, archways, broken pillars, and
marble columns, the tourist can recognize the
location of some of the temples, theatres and
public buildings. These have recently been excavated
by Captain Wood, of England.</p>

<p>Returning to Smyrna, I immediately come
aboard the good ship “Mars.” She at once
lifts her anchors, and spreads her sails to the
breezes; and soon Smyrna, like Ephesus, Constantinople,
and Athens, is among the places that
“I have left behind.” The first landing is Chios
(Acts xx: 15;) then passing by Samos we come
next morning, about eight o’clock, to the island
of Patmos, known throughout Christendom as the
exiled home of the Beloved Disciple. The island
is a solid and irregular mass of rock, bleak and
barren. It is ten miles long, and five miles in
breadth. The cave, or grotto, in which John is
said to have written the Apocalypse is used as a
chapel. In this chapel, numerous lights are kept
burning, and on its walls are rudely depicted various
scenes taken from the Apocalypse. Patmos
is now inhabited by 4,000 Greeks, who have two
sources of income. One is fishing, while their
second main occupation is stealing.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>On the island of Rhodes (Rev. xxi; 1), we
visit the place where once stood the celebrated
“Colossus of Rhodes,” known as one of the wonders
of the ancient world. The Colossus was a
bronze statue 105 feet high. It stood across the
narrow harbor, so that ships entering the port
would pass between its legs. The statue is said
to have cost a half million dollars.</p>

<p>We are now anchored at Larnaca, the principal
town on the island of Cyprus. Cyprus was the
home of Barnabas, and the scene of some of
Paul’s missionary work. We have anticipated
much pleasure in traveling over this historic island.
But alas, alas! thoughts of pleasure have
fled, and dread suspicions are now entertained.
Some fearfully contagious disease has broken out
on our vessel. The doctor says it is small-pox,
but some of us fear it is cholera. Small-pox is
prevalent in Constantinople, and people have
been dying from it in Smyrna, whence we came,
at the rate of one hundred and fifty per day.
Malta, which is only some few hours away, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
suffering most fearfully from cholera. We have
been here now twenty-four hours. We are quarantined,
and are not allowed to land or even to
discharge the sick. The passengers are panic-stricken.
The most intense excitement prevails.
The flags of disease and death are floating at our
mast-head. It does not make one feel at all
pleasant to see these flags, especially when one
remembers that he is many thousand miles from
home and loved ones. I should not like to be
buried in the sea, nor yet in a foreign land among
strangers. When I have finished life’s work, and
the watchers shall fold my pale hands upon my
breast and softly whisper, “He is dead,” I want to
be carried back to my own native land, and there
buried in some quiet church-yard, where those
whom I have known and loved in life can occasionally
come and plant evergreens and forget-me-nots
over my grave. The only consolation I
have at present is that God, who doeth all things
well, knoweth best. I therefore cheerfully commit
my body, soul and spirit, to the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, now and forever.</p>

<p class="drop-capi15">WE have reached Beyrout at last. It is a
gracious relief to escape from that disease-stricken
ship. I feel like kneeling down
and kissing the earth. I think every passenger
lifts his heart in grateful praise to God for deliverance.
I can but say: “Bless the Lord, O my

praise Him for deliverance from danger and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>
<p>I can not tell&mdash;I do not know&mdash;when
the seed was planted, but some ten years ago the
plant of desire sprang up in my heart. I did not
pluck it up. Gradually its rootlets intertwined
themselves with the fibres of my very being, and
finally they took deep root in my soul. Five
years later the buds of hope appeared. I was
happy. The plant was nurtured with patience
and with care. The buds grew into flowers, and
now the fruit appears. First, the desire, then the
hope, and now the realization. Yes, for years I
have thought of traveling through Palestine.
This trip became my thought by day and my
dream by night. I have often made nocturnal
visits to Bethlehem and Calvary. While asleep I
have wandered through the streets of Jerusalem;
in my dreams I have seen Nazareth nestling on
the hillside, and Damascus reposing in the valley.
That desire grew stronger and stronger. It became
the ruling passion of my life, and I said:
“By God’s help I will go.” I set my face like a
flint towards the Holy Land, and hither I have
come. I feel profoundly thankful that that which
was my youth’s fondest hope is now my manhood’s
first glory to realize.</p>

<p>I have already begun the journey “through
Palestine in the saddle,” and if the reader will
exercise some of that “patience” which “beareth
all things,” I will tell him who my companions are,
and what the mode of traveling is in this country.
Afterwards I may say something concerning the
appearance and condition of the country; also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
something about the customs and habits of the
people.</p>

<p>I have become quite a pedestrian, and I had
hoped to go through Palestine and Syria, as I
went through several European countries&mdash;on
foot. But since arriving here I find that a “tramp
trip” is quite impracticable, if not altogether impossible.
I never undertake impossibilities, hence
I give up my scheme of walking.</p>

<p>While Johnson and I were traveling in Bulgaria,
we met Mr. Wm. Y. Hamlin and two ladies
from Detroit, Michigan. The two ladies were
sisters. One of them was unmarried; the other
was Mr. Hamlin’s deceased wife’s mother. We
met them again in Constantinople and some time
afterward in Smyrna. We spent several days together
around the islands and on the waters of
the Mediterranean. The two parties proved mutually
agreeable. So we have now resolved ourselves
into one party for a trip through Syria and
Palestine. We employ the same Dragoman who
furnishes everything, and pays all expenses of the
journey from one end to the other. We are to
ride on horses and camels, and sleep in tents.
Four days are required to make preparation, nor
are four days any too many. Camels, and horses,
and donkeys, and mules, and bridles, and saddles,
and whips, and spurs, and tents, and beds, and
provisions, and cooking utensils, are to be made
ready. Packing is to be done, letters are to be
written, and costumes purchased. The American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Consul is to be seen officially, Turkish passports
are to be gotten, and a number of other things to
be looked after. What I have to do during these
four days reminds me of the man who was, at one
and the same time, a lawyer, a merchant, a druggist,
a dentist, a physician, a shoemaker, a miller,
pastor of four churches and general missionary
besides!</p>

<p>At two o’clock on Saturday every thing is pronounced
ready, and from that good hour we are
to be known as the “Equestrian Pilgrims.” What
a formidable turnout is ours! A veritable caravan!
To accommodate and serve <i>five pilgrims</i> we
have seven tents&mdash;I have to sleep in two tents&mdash;fifteen
body-guards, or muleteers, and thirty head
of camels, mules and donkeys! Nor is this all.
Chairs and tables, tents and trunks, beds and
blankets, and a hundred other things, are tied
together and strapped on the backs of the animals.
Thus laden, each little donkey, as he goes
jogging along, looks like a veritable Jumbo; and
the camels, with these great packs on their backs,
look almost like walking mountains! These are
all strung out one after another&mdash;one after another,
the front end of the rear camel being tied
to the hind end of the one before him, and that
one to the next, and so on. I have been reading
about caravans all my life and now I have one of
my own. I am told to choose any one of the
animals I want to ride, whereupon I select a small
donkey, mouse-colored, except for the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
stripes that wind around him&mdash;these give him
something of a zebra-like appearance. I want to
show the natives how supple I am, and, going up
to the donkey and putting my arms on his back, I
try to leap up. But, unfortunately, I leap over,
and come down on the other end of my neck.
Amid the loud acclamations of the natives, the
stately procession moves off. The stars and
stripes flutter in the breezes, while the music of
the national hymn is borne away over the sea on
the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>The narrow streets of Beyrout are soon quitted,
and we at once begin the ascent of Lebanon.
The first thing that attracts our attention is a
wide world of mulberry trees&mdash;it looks about
seventeen thousand acres on either side of the
road. The trees appear to be about eighteen
feet high. Half naked boys and girls, men and
women have climbed up the trees and are plucking
off the leaves here and there. I don’t know
what to make of it. The first thought that suggests
itself is that “fig-leaf dresses” have come in
fashion again. But Tolhammy my dragoman,
says: “This is a great country for silk culture,
and mulberry trees are cultivated, and the leaves
gathered for the silk worms.” In Damascus he
says we shall see plenty of silk manufactured by
hand.</p>

<p>We meet a great many Arabs going into the
city that we have just left. Several miles back I
stopped one of these sons of the desert for a conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
I think we talked about an hour and
thirteen minutes, more or less, and would, no
doubt, have talked longer, but neither one of us
understood a word the other said. Occasionally
there was a lag in the conversation. While I
was gathering this valuable information from the
stranger, the other part of the caravan slacked
never a pace. And now, looking aloft, I see high
on the mountain-side a white city&mdash;a city of tents.
This reminds me of Balaam who was traveling in
this same country not far from here, and, seeing a
sight just like this, he exclaimed: “How goodly
are thy tabernacles, O Jacob and thy tents, O
Israel!”</p>

<p>The road, gleaming in the sunshine, looks at
one time like a clothes-line hanging on the mountain-side;
again it resembles a winding serpent
crawling zigzag up the mountain as though it
wants to swallow the tents. Climbing the hill, we
pass a number of dilapidated villages on the right
and left of the road. Just as the sun goes down
to cool his hot face in the Mediterranean, we
reach the tents pitched on Mt. Lebanon! At last
the city is before us. Dismounting, and going
into our new apartments, we can hardly believe
we are in tents. The walls and ceiling look
like white marble newly painted and beautifully
frescoed. The rock floor is spread with rich
Persian carpets and mats. Here are rocking-chairs,
tables, bedsteads, washstands&mdash;every thing!
“What style!” I say to the party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>While we are rejoicing, in steps an Arab and
says: “Solimat neharicsiade emborak.” Joy departs
at these words. With a look of surprise
and a feeling of regret I say, “Sir?” He responds,
“Solimat neharicsiade emborak.” Rising to my
feet I say, “Repeat that remark, please.” Gesticulating
wildly, the Arab repeats with great emphasis,
“<i>Solimat neharicsiade emborak!</i>” I thought he
said my horse was loose. But after a while,
however, the Arab, by means of signs, gives me
to understand that nothing serious has occurred;
that he came in only to let me know supper is
ready. I feel relieved and delighted. After a
long ride over a rough country, we all have good
appetites, and the announcement of supper is
therefore joyful news. The evening meal being
over, the pilgrims draw their chairs close together
and sit for an hour or more talking about friends
at home, about the past history and present condition
of this country, and about Him whose
footsteps have hallowed its soil. The prospect
of traveling through this country thrills us all.
Substituting the word Hill, for Grail, I can appropriate
the language of Tennyson:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Never yet has the sky appeared so blue, nor earth so green,<br />
For all my blood dances in me, and I know<br />
That I shall light upon the Holy Grail.”</p>

<p class="p1">Night brings sweet rest to our tired bodies.
Early in the morning, bright rays of cheerful
sunshine steal into our tents and drive sleep away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
We awake to find a bright, beautiful Sabbath day;
and while with our bodies it is to be a day of rest,
we pray that with our souls it may be a Sabbath
day’s journey towards the New Jerusalem. Stillness
pervades the air. The solemn silence is
broken only by the mournful music of yonder
restless sea. All the pilgrims except Johnson
spend the day reading and meditating. He occupies
the time in writing to his&mdash;to his&mdash;grandmother.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon our attention is attracted
by an unheard of medley of sound. The noise
that falls upon our ears is not more strange than
the sight that greets our eyes is curious. The
dragoman tells us not to be alarmed, and says it
is only a wedding procession. Johnson is glad of
that. I stand it for his sake. The procession
consists of about a hundred persons, ninety-eight
on foot and two riding grey horses, all singing
and dancing as they come. Ten or twelve of the
footmen are in front of the horses, while the
others are behind. The leader of the van is an
Arab of unusual length and gracefulness, clad in
the most fantastic robes imaginable. In his two
hands he holds a stick about six feet long, wrapped
around with gay and fancy colors. The leader
is coming backward, facing the advancing
throng and keeps about ten paces in front of them.
He is first on one side of the road and then on
the other. He leaps; he bobs up and down: he
bows and bends. At one moment his face is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
on the ground, and the next his head is
tossed high in the air. The stick is waved like a
magician’s wand. The man is active as a cat and
every movement is graceful. As he leads, the
others follow his example. They all hop and skip
and bow and bend and rise and fall together.
Some sing while others blow or knock discordant
sounds out of their rude instruments of music.</p>

<p>Never before did Johnson behold a sight like
this, nor until now did such a babbling confusion
ever strike his ears. The procession draws close.
The two persons on horseback are riding side by
side. One is the bride, decked in colors gay and
wreathed with flowers many. There are two tall
men walking, one on either side of the horse, with
their arms locked around the bride; I suppose to
keep her from falling. Johnson touches me in the
side and says: “Whittle, if that were my bride, I
wouldn’t let those fellows do that.” The bride’s
face, according to the custom of the country, is
covered by a long, flowing veil. The man by her
side is not the groom. A man in this country will
not condescend to go after a woman&mdash;not even
after his bride! Woman is an inferior creature&mdash;she
must humble herself and go to the man.
The groom sends his friend or his servant for her,
and I understand she is always willing to come.
Johnson says it is very different in America. He
says one refused to go with him when he went
after her in person.</p>

<p>Brides are bought and sold here now as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
were in olden times, though there has been a
great increase in price. Hebrews are good traders
and always have been. In Bible times they
bought wives for twenty-five dollars, but now
brides in this country sell for from seventy-five to
one hundred dollars. I believe the men would
buy them even if the price should be still higher.
Of course they would buy them. Women are
slaves. They are man’s burden-bearers and nothing
more! The Mohammedans have two, four or
a half dozen wives. The Sultan has five hundred,
and the people follow his example as far as
possible.</p>

<p>The wedding festivities, consisting of music,
songs and dancing, last for a week, and then the
bride is converted into a slave for her husband.
In a few months she will probably be a slave for
his next wife!</p>

<p>Monday morning bright and early, we fold our
tents and renew our pilgrimage. Lebanon continues
steep, rocky, rough and bare. Not a bush,
not a blade of green grass, nothing but a long
mountain range covered with loose stones, is to
be seen. The hills are very productive&mdash;of rocks.
Now and then we come to large camel pastures.
As these long-legged, high-headed, two-storied
animals are fat and flourishing, I conclude that
they live on wind and stones. In the road we
meet hundreds and hundreds of big camels and
little camels, dun-colored, mouse-colored, white
and black camels, laden with all kinds of oriental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
merchandise. Late in the afternoon, we for the
first time catch a glimpse of snow-capped Hermon,
some fifty miles away to the southwest. We take
off our hats to this mountain monarch, promising
him a visit later on. We now descend into the
green valley, sixteen and a half miles wide and
some sixty miles long, lying between Lebanon
and anti-Lebanon. We want to see the Cedars
of Lebanon; and in order to do this we are compelled
just here to quit the Damascus road, and
travel for three days up this beautiful valley,
keeping close to the Lebanon side.</p>

<p>On the second day, traveling up this valley, we
come to what tradition says is Noah’s tomb.
Strange to say this tomb is <i>eighty-five feet long</i>.
It is built of stone and is eight feet wide, seven
feet high and eighty-five feet long! Seeing this, I
am at once reminded of an incident that is said
to have occurred with an American preacher. At
the close of the Saturday service, the clergyman
announced that he would preach again on Sunday,
after reading a certain portion of scripture.
Before the hour for Sunday service, some mischievous
boys slipped into the church with a
bottle of glue and pasted two leaves of the Bible
together, so that in reading the minister would
miss connection. Eleven o’clock came, and with
it came also a large concourse of people. Ascending
the pulpit, the reverend gentleman opened
the sacred book and began to read. On the
bottom of one page he read: “And Noah, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
he was an hundred and twenty years old, took
unto himself a wife who was”&mdash;and then turning
over the leaf and missing connection, he continued,
“who was an hundred and eighty-six cubits
long, forty-seven cubits wide, built of gopher
wood, stuck with pitch inside and out.” With
trembling knees and confused head, the minister,
with stammering tongue said: “Brethren, I have
been preaching twenty years and yet I confess
that I have never seen this in the Bible before.
But it is here and I accept it. Yes, brethren, I
accept it as an undying evidence of the fact that
we are fearfully and wonderfully made.” So,
since I find that Noah’s tomb is eighty-five feet
long, I am not much surprised to learn that Mrs.
Noah was one hundred and eighty-six cubits long.</p>

<p>Day has succeeded night again. This is the
third day since we left the Damascus road. We
are now camped in the valley at the base of
Lebanon, which is at this point 10,000 feet high
and almost as steep as the roof of a house. Many
loose rocks and bowlders of all shapes and sizes
are scattered promiscuously over the mountain
side. There is no road to be seen&mdash;nothing more
than a cow trail or hog path. And yet in order to
see a single Cedar we are compelled to climb to
yonder giddy heights. Well, we all start&mdash;three
gentlemen and two ladies. One woman soon
gives out, but the other is the kind of a woman
who, when she says, “I will,” means with a twist
on it, “<i>I will!</i>” She says that she started and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
she is going. She reminds me of the French
woman who started to the top of Mont Blanc.
Twelve hundred feet before reaching the summit
she gave out, and, being dragged by guides, she
kept crying: “If I die carry me to the top.”</p>

<p>To climb Lebanon at this place is barely within
the limits of possibility. The way is steep, high
and rough, and at times perilous. To be sure, on
foot one could climb it without danger, but not
without great physical exertion. On horseback,
however, it is a hazardous undertaking. No four-footed
animal, save a mountain goat or an Arabian
steed, dare undertake the ascent. If I live
to get down, I shall christen my Arabian pony
“Amnon, the reliable, the sure-footed.” The
mountain is scaled, the summit is reached, and no
Cedars yet. I am now standing on the heights
of Lebanon, looking down upon the blue Mediterranean
10,000 feet below me and only three
miles away towards the setting sun. The gray
clouds, lying along the western horizon, look like
white-winged ships floating on the bosom of the
sea. For aught I know, they are ships freighted
with whirlwinds and thunder-storms; or perchance
they may be&mdash;I hope they are&mdash;freighted with
rain to refresh this parched earth.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">CEDARS OF LEBANON.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Leaving the summit and coming down three
thousand feet on the western side, I find myself
resting under the venerable Cedars of Lebanon,
seven thousand feet above the sea. It is a perfect
day. The sky is of a rich, deep, azure blue and
seems only a few feet above me. The atmosphere
is pure and crisp. It is a glorious thing to be
here. Look where you will, you find something
to admire. The air is delightful; the earth, sea
and sky are beautiful; but the waving Cedars are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the one central object of interest and admiration&mdash;their
age, their history, their beauty! Then
come the sacred associations that cluster about
the Cedars of Lebanon. All my life I have been
reading of these trees. Before I could read,
my mother used to sing me a sweet song about
the Cedars of Lebanon. All of mother’s songs
were sweet, but especially sweet, I thought, was
this one about the Cedars. And now I am here
looking at them with my own eyes. Of all trees
on earth those are by far the most renowned.
Of all the vegetable kingdom they are the crowning
glory.</p>

<p>From this mountain Solomon got the timber
to build his temple on Mount Moriah. In all
probability some of these trees that I am now
looking at were here in Solomon’s day. I feel
that I am in the presence of Age. These venerable
Cedars are not ringed round by years or
decades, but by centuries! And yet their wrinkles
may be counted by the score. These trees are
mentioned more than twenty-five times in the
pages of Sacred Writ. They are called “goodly
Cedars.”</p>

<p>As I see these historic trees bowing and bending
in the cold and cutting breeze, I am naturally
reminded of a thought beautifully expressed by
the “sweet singer of Israel” where he says:
“There shall be an handful of corn in the earth
on the tops of the mountain; the fruit thereof
shall shake like Lebanon, and they of that city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
shall flourish like grass.” We are told also that
“the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree
and grow like a Cedar of Lebanon.” I wonder
why and how it is that the righteous can grow
like a Cedar in Lebanon. Upon examination I
find that these Cedars grow on a mountain top;
that they grow out of a rock; that they are rooted
in barrenness. I find that every crack and
crevice in the rock is filled with their roots and
fibres. The roots of the trees shoot themselves
deep down through the rended rocks and take a
firm hold upon the eternal hills. And when
earthquakes come and the mountains reel and
totter on their bases; when cyclones come with
death and destruction locked up in their wings;
when the storms howl and the sea is lashed into
rage and fury,&mdash;the Cedars of Lebanon do then
bow and bend gracefully in the breezes; but they
are uprooted never. They say,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Let the winds be shrill,<br />
Let the waves roll high,<br />
We fear not wind or wave.”</p>

<p class="p1">And when the earthquakes have ceased and the
mountains no longer reel; when the cyclones have
passed; when the sea is lulled to sleep and the
winds are only a whisper, then the Cedars of Lebanon
lift themselves up in their pillared majesty,
spread wide their broad arms and look up smilingly
in the face of God as if to say: “We thank
thee, O Lord God Almighty, for the firm footing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
that thou hast given us in the eternal rocks&mdash;in
the everlasting hills.” I thank thee, O God, that
the righteous grow like the Cedars of Lebanon.
I bless thee that the righteous grow on a mountain
top&mdash;on mount Calvary; that they grow out
of a rock&mdash;Jesus Christ, the Rock of Ages.</p>

<p>Wherever the nails have torn His hands and
His feet, where the cruel spear has pierced His
side, these are the cracks and crevices where the
roots and fibres of my heart can so fix and fasten
themselves that when earthquakes social and cyclones
moral shall come, I will be uprooted never.
I may bow and bend with the breezes, but when
the earthquakes have passed and the storms are
no more; when the waves of infidelity have passed,
as always passed they have and always pass
they must, then I will look up smilingly in the face
of Jehovah and say: “I thank thee, O God, that
none of these things move me; that I can say
with Paul of old, ‘I am rooted and grounded in
Christ;’ that I stand now and forever unmoved
and immovable, like the Cedars!”</p>

<p>Reader, I have just stated that Solomon secured
timber from this mountain to build the great temple
in Jerusalem. It is quite possible that some
of the trees before me were here in Solomon’s
day, and that because of their knots and roughness
they were rejected by his workmen. We are
told that God is building another temple in that
other Jerusalem, and that our characters are to
furnish the sticks of timber out of which it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
be built. We should see to it that our characters
will not be rejected, but that they will be smoothed
and polished ready to be wrought into that
spiritual temple which shall stand throughout the
endless cycles of eternity!</p>

<p>The Cedars of Lebanon have almost become
sacred, holy trees. I am therefore grieved to find
so few of them left. This long mountain range
that was once covered with them is now as bare
as if it had never known any vegetation. Seeing
that only a few hundred of the old Cedars remain,
I am reminded of the language of Zechariah:
“Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may
devour thy Cedars. Howl, fir-tree, for the Cedar
is fallen. Howl, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the
forest of the vintage has come down.” Most of
the Cedars have indeed “come down,” but some
of the remaining ones are splendid enough to
make up for those that are gone. One of these
patriarchs of the forest is forty-eight feet in circumference.
Some of them rise up in their pillared
majesty for eighty, one hundred or one hundred
and twenty-five feet high, I suppose. Some
of the largest ones are probably one hundred and
fifty feet across, from bough to bough. The limbs
usually grow out from the trunk at right angles.
Other limbs grow out from those at right angles
and so on, until even the smallest branches and
twigs are horizontal like arbor vitæ, except that
arbor vitæ stands up and the Cedar lies down flat
like a shingle. One limb of the Cedar is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
much like a square of shingles on a flat-roofed
house, and when limb is placed above limb they
form a roof that turns water very well, and shuts
out much of the sunlight. Another peculiarity of
the Lebanon Cedar is that it bears a cone something
like our pine burrs, except that it never
opens.</p>

<p>Again, I say it is a grand, a glorious, a sweet
privilege to sit beneath the wide-spreading branches
of these time-honored trees and read what holy
men of old wrote concerning them. But the day
is far spent. Amnon is saddled. I must mount
and see if he proves worthy of his new name.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi12">LEAVING the Cedars, and descending to the
base of the mountain where the tents were
left, we start across the beautiful valley lying
between the long mountain of Lebanon and anti-Lebanon.
Before reaching the valley proper we
are compelled to cross some rough mountain
spurs and to go through some narrow mountain
passes. It so happens that we meet a train of
heavily laden camels. The fanatical and blood-thirsty
Arabs managing the camels stop their
caravan and obstinately refuse to give any part of
the pass. Our body-guards come up. A quarrel
ensues. A war of words leads to blows, and we
have, enacted before our own eyes, a second
“Battle of the Giants.” It looks to Johnson like
the first one. The two parties, consisting of
about forty Arabs, curse, threaten, close on each
other, clinch, fight like fiends, grapple like giants.
They fall to the earth in each other’s embrace,
roll over, first one on top and then the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
They bite, kick and scratch each other. Together
they fall and together they rise again&mdash;one bites
the dust and then another. Javelins are used.
Stones fly, sabres flash&mdash;gods! how they fight!
Heads are mashed and limbs are broken. Hair
flies and blood flows. The horses scare, the
women scream and Johnson looks as if he wants
to say:</p>

<p class="pp10q p1">“Lay on, MacDuff,</p>
<p class="pp6">And damned be he who first cries, ‘Hold, enough!’”</p>

<p class="p1">At last the enemy is repulsed and victory
perches upon our banner. The dust and din of
battle are no more. We are relieved; for danger
was imminent and suspense correspondingly great.
It is the greatest wonder, and also the greatest
blessing imaginable, that no one was killed. If
one of the natives had been killed, I am sure the
whole community would have been aroused, and
would have poured out their indignation and wrath
upon our Christian heads&mdash;”Christian dogs,” they
call us. I see from the <i>London Times</i> that only a
few weeks ago twenty-four Christians were killed
in a fray with the Arabs, not far from this place.
We would not willingly harm a hair of their
heads. All we wanted was room to pass, and
having secured that we continue our journey.</p>

<p>The mountain gap lets us once more into the
valley which is, as before stated, fifteen to eighteen
miles wide and some sixty miles long. In this
valley, and not far from here, is Riblah, where
Nebuchadnezzar had his headquarters during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
campaign against Jerusalem. When the holy
city fell, Zedekiah, King of Judea, fled to Jericho
where he was captured, thence he was brought to
Riblah. Here, after witnessing the murder of his
sons, poor Zedekiah was subjected to the painful
ordeal of having his eyes put out. To this place,
also, Pharaoh Necho, after his brilliant victory
over the Babylonians, summoned Jehoahaz from
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The valley is now used as pastures and farming
lands; wheat, oats and grapes being the principal
productions. The river Leontes flows through
the plain, and the fields are watered mostly by
irrigation. Yet these people are only playing
with agriculture. The valley is rich and fertile,
and would abundantly reward honest labor. But
honest labor is unknown in Syria. These trifling
people anger the soil with their rude implements
of agriculture, and the soil answers with a crop of
thorns and thistles. She thrusts out her claws
and thus frights off the lean, lazy, leisure-loving
Bedouin. The people sow the seeds of idleness
and reap the legitimate fruits&mdash;hunger, want and
starvation. I never before knew what squalid
poverty meant. But if it is to go half naked, and
almost the other half, too; if it is for human
beings to live in the same rock-pens with cows,
goats and asses, and that, too, without a fireplace,
without chairs, tables or bedsteads; if it is to live
on half rations of “husks and hominy,”&mdash;if this is
squalid poverty, I have seen it and know what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
means. Each family seems to be blest with a
dozen or fifteen heirs&mdash;heirs of filth and poverty!
I am reminded of the old adage, “poor people for
children and negroes for dogs.” These people
and their ancestry have inhabited this country
only 4,000 years, and yet within that short time
they have managed to accumulate a mass of filth
and ignorance that is truly astonishing.</p>

<p>We are now encamped in the citadel of Baalbek.
This place has much interest for the traveler
and the historian, because of its once mighty
temples. The temples were three in number.
They were all built on the same stupendous substructions.
The rock foundations go deep into
the ground, and are traversed by great subterranean
passages which look like railroad tunnels
through mountains of granite. The Temple of
the Sun was three hundred feet long, one hundred
and sixty feet wide, and was surrounded by fifty-four
columns, six of which are standing at present.
These six are enough for twelve months’ study.
They are solid marble, eight feet in diameter, and
together with the entablature which joins them at
the top, ninety feet high! How shapely, how
graceful, how towering and sublime! The carving
on the entablature is exquisite. It looks like
stucco work. The other columns are fallen and
broken, but these six look as if they were put up
only yesterday.</p>

<p>The Great Temple is better preserved; its potent
walls, and twenty-three of its Corinthian columns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
still stand. There is no wood about the
building. Even its vaulted roof, one hundred feet
above you, is marble. The under side of this
marble roof is beautifully chiseled. As one views
it with the natural eye, it look like delicate lace
work; but by the aid of field glasses one can
trace the designs of the artist, and see that “there
is method in his madness.” One can see men,
animals, leaves, flowers and fruits delicately carved
in the high lifted stone. One sees, or fancies
he sees, oaks and acorns, moons and mares, men,
mice and monkeys, doves, dogs and donkeys,
bulls, boars and bears, pigs, ‘possums and puppies,
boys and bonnets, ladies and lizards, all beautifully
carved and sweetly blended one with the
other. “‘Tis a vision, ‘tis an anthem sung in
stone, a poem writ in marble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>But probably the thing that most impresses
one about the ruins of Baalbek is the enormous
size of the stones used in its buildings. I have
never seen or read of such stones as were used in
building these temples. Many of them are as
large as one of our ordinary freight cars. Three
of these stones, lying end to end in the walls of
the temple, measure two hundred and ten feet.
I go to the quarry, half a mile away, from which
these colossal stones were taken. There I find a
companion stone to those in the buildings. It is
fourteen feet high, seventeen feet broad and
seventy-one feet long. Who ever heard of such
stones being handled! Two six mule teams might
be driven side by side on the stone, and there
would be room for a foot path on either side the
wagons. No pigmies they&mdash;those builders of
Baalbek. A race of giants or of gods must have
handled these stones! No one knows when, how,
or by whom these temples were built. We know
this, however, they were built, not for an age, but
for all time.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">AT four o’clock, on the second day after leaving
Baalbek, I spy one of the prettiest objects
that ever greeted human vision. It is
Damascus, the oldest city in the world&mdash;Damascus,
laid out by Uz, the great-grandson of Noah.
For days I have been riding over a ruined and
desolate country, and now my eyes fall and feast
on a broad, rich valley, through which flow Abana
and Pharpar, two rivers of pure water. The whole
valley is one great garden, or orchard, in which
flourishes almost every tropical plant. Here are
the orange, olive and oleander, the peach, pear,
palm and pome-granate, the banana, the apple,
apricot and myrtle. Amid the rich green foliage
of these trees, their golden fruit is seen. Autumn,
which is only summer meeting death with a smile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
has seared the leaves of some of the more delicate
plants of the valley. Red leaves are beautifully
interwoven with the green, and they gleam in the
rays of the setting sun like sheets of purest gold.
Here and there tall and slender silver poplars rise
high, and are gracefully swaying to and fro in the
evening breezes.</p>

<p>Damascus is situated in the midst of this luxuriant
garden. Looking down from the hilltop I see
the taller houses, the mosques and minarets, rising
from amidst the luxuriant foliage of the trees.
Ah, what a picture! According to tradition, when
Mohammed reached this point and looked down
upon Damascus for the first time, he said: “Man
can enter only one paradise, and I prefer to enter
the one above.” So he sat down here and feasted
his eyes upon the earthly paradise of Damascus
and went away without entering its gates, that
hereafter he might be permitted to enter the
portals of the paradise of God. A stone tower
marks the spot where the prophet stood. From
that early period Damascus has been regarded by
all Arabs as an earthly reflection of paradise, where
a foretaste of all the joys of heaven are obtainable.
In accordance with the description given
in the Koran, the Mohammedan Bible, Arabs
picture to themselves paradise as a limitless
orchard, traversed by streams of water, where the
most delicious fruits are ever ready to drop into
the mouth.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">DAMASCUS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>When we remember that Damascus is situated
on the edge of the great Syrian desert, that it is
surrounded on three sides by hills, high and lifted
up, and that the whole country for miles and
scores of miles around is bleak, parched and desolate,
we can not for a moment be surprised at the
pleasing effect the sight of this smiling garden
produces in the heart of the Arab. Probably
these swarthy sons of the desert have been traveling
for ten days or a fortnight, coming from
Palmyra or Bagdad, coming from central Arabia
or Persia, coming across the arid plain where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
naught but broad oceans of sand stretch out before
them, with not a blade of green grass to
enliven the scene or to “rest the dazzled sight.”
Finally the fortnight has past; the journey has
ended; and the Arabs stand at last upon this
hilltop and look down upon yonder green garden
of God. In contemplating such a scene, after
such a journey, these sons of Ishmael are moved
by emotions strong and deep. They have found
trees in the wilderness, springs in the desert; and
they can but say: “Though old as history itself,
thou art fresh as the breath of spring, blooming
as thine own rosebud, and fragrant as thine own
orange-blossom, O Damascus, pearl of the East.”</p>

<p>This is the scene that Paul was looking upon
when suddenly a great light shone round about
him from heaven, and he fell to the earth as dead.
Only a few feet from where I stand, tradition
points out the place where he fell. Paul, you
remember, was taken up and carried into the city.
Desiring to follow him, I leave the mountain top
and approach the valley. Damascus is surrounded
now, as in Paul’s day, by a stone wall twenty-five
or thirty feet high. Entering the city through
the Jerusalem gate, I am at once attracted by a
man prostrate on the river bank. Placing his
palms on the ground, and lifting himself the
length of his long arms, he looks down upon the
glassy surface of the river as though he were
gazing at his image reflected in the water. Then,
bending his elbows, he once more lets his breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to the earth. This is repeated over and over
again. While going through this strange performance,
the man is constantly mumbling and muttering
in some unknown Eastern tongue. Rising
to his feet, and lifting his face to the sky, the Arab
repeatedly smites himself upon the brow, breast
and mouth. Then waving his hand towards
Heaven, he cries aloud: “Suah baha, yalla Mohammed,
Mohammed, Mohammed!” I ask, “Tolhammy,
what means this?” “Why, sir, that is a
sacred river. The man was worshipping the river,
and then, rising, he called upon Mahomet, his god,
to accept his worship. He says ‘O Mahomet,
accept my worship, and (placing his hand on his
brow) I will think of thee with this mind; (on
his breast) I will love thee with this heart; (with
hand upon his mouth) and with these lips I will
speak thy praises abroad. Hear me, O Mohammed,
Mohammed, Mohammed!’” Who could see
a sight like this without thinking of Him who
said: “Pray not upon the street corners, to be
seen of men; but pray secretly, and your Father
who seeth in secret, will reward you openly.”</p>

<p>The valley was charming, even when viewed
from the hilltop; but the laughing water, the
green foliage and the golden fruit have grown
more and more beautiful as we have approached
nearer to them. “Abana and Pharpar, rivers of
Damascus,” are each divided into eight artificial
channels, so there are sixteen small rivers flowing
through the city, bringing fresh and sparkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
water into almost every yard. The luxuriant
vegetation of this well-watered valley is never
scorched by summer’s fierce heat, nor chilled by
winter’s frosty breath. It is a perpetual growth.
Flowers and fruits are always on the trees, fragrance
and music always in the air.</p>

<p>Damascus is the capital of Syria. It has one
hundred and eighty thousand inhabitants, and a
large manufacturing interest. As a commercial
and distributing centre, it has no equal in the
Orient. Great camel caravans are constantly arriving
from, and departing for, Palmyra and Bagdad,
and all the other more important cities of
Persia and central Arabia. Being an inland city,
hence unaffected by European thought and civilization,
Damascus is exclusively Eastern; and is,
therefore, the best place on earth to get correct
conceptions of Oriental life and ideas.</p>

<p>Coming into the midst of the city, we find the
houses are quaint and characteristically Eastern.
From their appearance, one would suppose that
they were built 1,500 or 2,000 years ago. Most of
them are one story high, and are built of stone,
and large sun-dried brick made half and half of
straw and white clay. Sometimes a dozen or
twenty houses are covered by the same roof. On
going into some of these miserable-looking huts,
we are reminded that “often in wooden houses
golden rooms we find.” Some of these wealthy
Damascene merchants live in style&mdash;not in American
or European style, but in style after the Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
idea. Their houses, though small, and rough
of exterior are richly furnished. Frequently they
are lined with marble. The walls and ceilings are
beautifully frescoed, while the floor is laid with
rich Persian carpets. And yet in these houses we
find no chairs, tables or bedsteads. The merchants,
though dressed in silks, sit flat on the
carpet or on small mats. Their beds consist,
usually, of pallets made of soft and beautiful
Persian rugs. “A strange way for wealthy people
to live,” you say. Well, yes, it is decidedly
strange to you; but you must remember that
your way of living would be just as strange to
these Damascene folk.</p>

<p>The streets are exceedingly narrow, being not
more than from nine to twelve feet wide. The
stores or shops on either side of the street are
little more than holes in the wall, usually about
six feet wide and eight feet deep. The floor of
this stall is twelve to eighteen inches above the
ground. The end facing the street is open, while
on the two sides and the back end, shelf rises
above shelf. Goods are arranged on these, and
also suspended from the ceiling. The customer,
should one chance to come along, stands in the
street and bargains with the merchant, who sits flat
on the floor in the centre of the stall. With a
hook in his hand, he, without rising, reaches to one
shelf or another, and drags down such goods as
may please the purchaser’s fancy. These people
eat no idle bread. As soon as the customer is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
gone, the merchant continues to manufacture saddles,
shoes, silks, or such goods as he may deal in.</p>

<p>I was never before so impressed with industry.
Damascus is a great manufacturing centre. The
people have no machinery&mdash;all work is done by
hand, and nothing is done within walls or behind
curtains. Caps and carpets, saddles and sabres,
shoes and shawls, silks and safes, beds and baskets,
and a hundred other things, are manufactured
on the streets in the open air before our eyes.
One entire street is given up to a single industry.
For instance the street here to my right is called
the shoe bazaar. It is probably a quarter of a
mile long; and on either side of the street, from
one end to the other, are men, women and children,
seated on mats or flat down on the ground
with their limbs folded under them. All are as
busy as bees, sewing and stitching leather, making
shoes. If one wants to buy a pair of shoes, he
trades with the man who makes them. The
merchant does not stop work, but talks without
looking up.</p>

<p>Most of the manufacturers are eager to trade
with Europeans and Americans, but some of them
are so fanatical that they will not receive money
from “Christian dogs.” Numerous poles are
thrown across the streets, twelve or fourteen feet
from the ground, from which strings are hanging.
When the shoes are finished, they are tied to these
strings and left suspended. Looking down the
street, one sees hundreds and hundreds of shoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
dangling in the air, about four feet from the
ground.</p>

<p>Silk bazaars are numerous. Looking down
these several streets, one sees many weavers seated
on the ground, plying their shuttles. Above
their uncombed heads is silk of every grade and
color, suspended in the air and trembling in the
wind. As with shoes and silks, so also with carpets,
saddles, and other departments of industry.</p>

<p>The leading industry of Damascus is cabinet-making.
The furniture made here is of the finest
woods, and is inlaid with mother-of-pearl; hence
it is perfectly exquisite and quite costly. Skilled
artisans are to be found in these different departments
of work. The best of them receive only
from sixty to eighty cents per day, while craftsmen
of equal skill, in our country, command four to
five dollars per day.</p>

<p>Thursday of each week presents a busy scene
at the donkey and camel markets. Hundreds of
half-dressed and hard-looking camel raisers from
the desert drive their patient beasts, old and
young, into an open square in the midst of the
city. Sellers, buyers and traders, wearing different
costumes, representing different tribes and
countries, meet. Going in among the camels,
they catch, ride and drive them. The animals are
priced, and trouble begins. The purchaser offers
the seller one-third, or one-fourth of his price.
This is taken as an insult. They quarrel, curse
each other, and sometimes fight, the friends on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
either side taking part. Finally the difficulty is
settled by an agreement to “split the difference;”
so the camel is sold at half of the first price&mdash;frequently
for less. Late in the evening they
adjourn in much disorder. Turbaned Arabs now
lead long trains of camels down different streets
to the several gates of the city. To-morrow morning,
at an early hour, these much abused “ships of
the desert” will be loaded and started out on a
long voyage across an ocean of sand.</p>

<p>The donkey-markets create less confusion.
Donkeys, however, have no unimportant part to
play in the daily life of Damascus. They are indispensable.
They take the place of our drays,
carts and market-wagons. One may look up the
street at almost any moment, and see a pair of
ears coming. This is regarded as a sure sign
that a progenitor of the mule will be along after
a while.</p>

<p>I repeat that all goods manufactured in Damascus
are made by hand, machinery being unknown.
Probably three-fourths of the people here never
saw or heard of a daily newspaper. They know
nothing of the outside world. They never learn
anything, never invent anything. They repudiate
and scorn anything that is new. They regard an
invention as an offspring of the devil. A Christian
they hate as they do a serpent. Ignorance
is the most prevalent thing in Damascus. It
walks the streets; it sits in the shops; it drives
camels; it stares the traveler in the face, go where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
he will. Here, too, as elsewhere, ignorance has
borne her legitimate fruit&mdash;superstition and fanaticism.
The people are, I believe, as fanatical as
the devil wants them to be. Only a few years
ago, their fanaticism arose to such a pitch that
they, without the slightest provocation, pounced
upon, and killed, five thousand Christians in the
streets of Damascus! Men, women and children
were butchered indiscriminately like sheep. Their
mangled bodies were piled up in the streets, and
scattered through the city, for days and days.
The Mohammedans would not defile their pure (?)
hands by putting them on “Christian dogs”&mdash;they
had killed them&mdash;that was enough. From Damascus
the thirst for blood spread throughout all
Syria, and no less than 14,000 Christians perished.</p>

<p>One would naturally suppose that the government
would protect life better than that. But the
Pasha, or governor, of Syria was the man who
gave the signal for the massacre to begin. And
it continued until the French government interfered.
Napoleon III, whom the world is so fond
of condemning, dispatched a body of ten thousand
well-armed troops here to stop that human
butchery. The Pasha and other officials were
arrested and beheaded in the city. The French
soldiers, following the custom of the old Romans,
constructed a military road from Beyrout to
Damascus. This road, which is still in good repair,
is the only guarantee of safety Christians
now have among these heathen people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>My guide in Damascus is named Abraham. I
have not met Isaac and Jacob, but have become
somewhat intimate with Abraham. He tells me
that his father and mother were victims of that
horrible massacre; that when killed, their blood
and brains spattered upon him; that his escape
was little less than miraculous; that he, with a
number of other Christians, was shut up in the
citadel for three days; that for three days and
nights the Mohammedans stood there with their
battering rams, thundering against the walls and
gates of the citadel, which were just ready to
totter and fall when the French army came up
and put a stop to the whole inhuman business.</p>

<p>Several persons who were eye-witnesses to the
whole scene have given me a full and detailed
account of the massacre. Mohammedans from
their beginning may be tracked through history
by a trail of blood. They seem to have a thirst
that nothing but human gore will satiate. This
massacre of Damascus is their last and crowning
act. It is worthy of their bloody history. They
destroyed “even till destruction sickened.” I have
just read a history of this fearful slaughter which
closes with this sentence: “Unfortunately, since
the massacre matters have improved but little.”
I dare not walk the streets of Damascus to-day
with a Bible in hand, and let the people know
what book it is. I would be in danger of being
brained before reaching the post-office.</p>

<p>The guide-book warns us not to look at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
women. This goes hard with Johnson. I regret
it on his account. There is a custom in this country,
which practically amounts to a law, that the
women shall keep their faces vailed. Yesterday,
while walking up a narrow and gloomy-looking
alley, we saw a woman coming towards us.
Touching me in the side with his elbow, Johnson
said: “Whittle, I am going to look at her a little,
anyhow.” When we met the woman, she piteously
cried: “Howazhu, howazhu, bachsheesh, bachsheesh,”
which being interpreted means, “O, gentlemen,
gentlemen, money, money.” Johnson responded:
“Lift your vail, then.” When the
ill-favored female drew her vail aside, Johnson
gave her three piasters (about nine cents) and
immediately said: “Put down your vail quickly,
and I will give you three more.” I was sorry for
my traveling companion. He looked disappointed.
He said that the reason the women had to
keep their faces covered was, that they were so
ugly that to expose them would subject men to
sore eyes&mdash;if not to blindness.</p>

<p>The early religious history of Damascus is of
peculiar interest to all Christians. A great persecution
arose against the Christians in Jerusalem.
Saul of Tarsus made havoc of the church; entering
into every house, and, haling men and women,
committed them to prison, breathing out threatenings
and slaughter against the disciples of the
Lord. He obtained letters from the Jewish authorities,
authorizing him to arrest and carry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Jerusalem all Christians whom he might find in
Damascus.</p>

<p>As he journeyed, he came near Damascus, and
suddenly there shined round about him a light
from Heaven, and he fell to the earth. When Saul
asked of the Lord, “What wilt thou have me to
do?” the Lord said unto him, “Arise, and go into
the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must
do.” Saul rose from the earth and they brought
him into Damascus, and he stopped with Judas,
who lived on the street that is called Straight.
The Lord directed Ananias to go to Saul, and
instruct him what to do. The scales fell from
Saul’s eyes, and he arose and was baptized; and
straightway he preached Christ, that he was the
Son of God. This created a great disturbance in
Damascus, and the Jews held a mass meeting and
decided to kill Saul. For this purpose the Jews
watched the gates of the city day and night. In
order to save his life, the disciples took Saul by
night and let him down by the wall in a basket.</p>

<p>Damascus is now pretty much as it was eighteen
hundred years ago. The places mentioned in
connection with Paul are still pointed out&mdash;with
what degree of certainty, I can not say. Of
course I visited the places where “he fell to the
earth,” and where “he was let down over the wall
in a basket.” At this point the wall is some thirty
feet high, and is surmounted by a house which is
occupied by a Christian family. The reputed
houses of Ananias and Judas are partly underground,
and are built of huge stones. These
strongly built houses are certainly very old; and
it has been suggested that if Ananias and Judas
did not live in them at the time of Paul, some
other people did.</p>

<p>If I should to-day begin to proclaim the gospel
of Christ with the same zeal and earnestness that
characterized the ministry of Paul, I would have
to be let down over the walls in a basket, or else
be butchered on the street.</p>

<p class="drop-capi15">NAAMAN lived in Damascus. “Now Naaman,
captain of the host of Syria, was a
great man” with his Master, and “honorable,
because by him the Lord had given deliverance
unto Syria; he was also a mighty man of
valor, but he was a leper.” So Naaman left
Damascus, and went down to Samaria to see
Elisha, that the prophet might heal him of the
leprosy. Elisha told Naaman to go and dip himself
seven times in the Jordan. The haughty
Syrian became indignant at the idea, and it was
natural that he should. The people of Damascus
are now, and have always been, proud of their
rivers. They sing about Abana and Pharpar, as
also about the shades, fruits and flowers of the
valley.</p>

<p>Old Naaman was a true Damascene. So, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
told to bathe in the Jordan, he said: “Abana and
Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, are they not better
than all the waters of Israel?” He wanted to go
back to his own native city, and there bathe in
the fountain of the gods, whose pearly waters had
rolled themselves through his heart and cut their
channels there. Finally Naaman was persuaded
to follow Elisha’s directions, and was healed of
his leprosy. But, strangely enough, his house in
Damascus was turned into a leper hospital, and
remains one to this day.</p>

<p>Having heard so much of this loathsome disease,
I am anxious to see it. So I call out, “Abraham,
Abraham.”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“Bring out the horses, and let’s go to the
hospital.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>He brings out three horses&mdash;ears about fifteen
inches long&mdash;and Johnson, Abraham and I are
off for the “lepers’ den.” On the way, Johnson
says: “Whittle, how long has the leprosy existed?”
My reply is, “History traces the disease back
to twelve or fifteen hundred years before the
Christian era.”</p>

<p>Johnson. “Where did it originate?”</p>

<p>I explain that the origin of the leprosy is, to
some extent, shrouded in mystery; that I was
reading the other day from Strabo, a Greek
author, who says that leprosy was generated in
Egypt among the Jews, while they were in bondage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
under the Pharaohs. He says the Jews were
banished to rock-quarries, where they had been
getting stone to build pyramids and walled cities;
that, having double burdens to perform, and half
rations to live upon, they killed and ate diseased
hogs which gave rise to a disease among the
people known as the leprosy. For this reason
the Jews passed a law that all Hebrews should
ever after abstain from eating flesh of swine.
That law, we know, is still observed, but Strabo’s
account of the origin of the leprosy is probably
a myth.</p>

<p>Johnson asks: “Does the Bible throw no light
upon this subject?”</p>

<p>“None at all. The Good Book has much to
say about the disease, and the ceremonial law
concerning the treatment of lepers is strict and
explicit. As to its origin, however, not a word
is said.”</p>

<p>Leprosy is the most fearful disease that was
ever visited upon the human family. Never yet
has a case of it been cured without the direct intervention
of God. Man’s skill is powerless to stay
its ravages on the human frame and system. If
there were no leprosy on earth to-day, probably
there never would be any. It is not now, so far
as can be ascertained, generated anew and afresh.
It is inherited from one’s parents, and in this way
it is handed down from generation to generation.
It is absolutely impossible for leprous parents to
give birth to a child who will not die of leprosy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
unless, perchance, the babe die before the disease
breaks out. The child may possibly remain
sound and healthy until he is six or even sixteen
years old; but the fearful disease is in his bones
and blood and system, and it is coming to the
surface&mdash;it is coming to stay, to eat up the body
and “steal away the life o’ the building.”</p>

<p>Leprosy warns its victim of its approach by a
cold and chilly sensation, which alternates with
fever. Then a purple fleck or blotch, with a hard
lump under it, comes on the face. The blotches
now come thick and fast. Blotch meets blotch,
until the bloated face is covered, and the cheeks
look like purple clusters of grapes. The blotches
finally swell, itch, fester, burst and pour forth an
immense amount of pus and corruption. Then
they heal up for a while, only, however, to itch,
swell and burst again.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half from the centre of the
city, we see a great rock wall, enclosing twenty or
more acres of land, rising up like the walls of
a penitentiary, twenty-five or thirty feet high.
Pointing to this wall, Abraham says: “There is
the hospital.”</p>

<p>I respond, “Yes, there it is, but I want to go in
it.”</p>

<p>“Want to go in it?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes, Abraham, and I want you to go with me.”</p>

<p>With a strange look in his face, and a tremor
in his voice, he answers, “You don’t mean that,
do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>“Most emphatically, I do. I want you to go in
with me.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” he continues, “I can’t do it.”</p>

<p>“But,” said I, “look here, Abraham, I have paid
you my money. You are my guide. You have
promised to show me through the city.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but I didn’t promise to go into the
tomb with you,” was his response.</p>

<p>Turning to Johnson, I request him to accompany
me. I show him a book which says that it
is questionable whether leprosy is at all contagious;
that it is possible for one to shake hands
with a leper without any ill effects. Besides, I
tell him that we will arm ourselves so as to keep
them away from us&mdash;that we will fill our pockets
with coins, and, if the lepers come close to us, will
strew them like seed corn on the ground, and
while they stop to gather them up, we will get a
good look at them. I explain further to my companion
that even if the lepers were disposed to
come up to us, we could fight them off with our
heavy canes.</p>

<p>After placing these arguments before him, I
make a final appeal; “Johnson, don’t desert me.
Nerve yourself and go in with me.” Seeing that
he is wavering and hesitating, I say: “Johnson,
screw your courage to the sticking point, and let’s
go in.”</p>

<p>He responds: “It won’t stick.”</p>

<p>“Try it again!”</p>

<p>He repeats, “<i>It won’t stick!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time we are at the heavy, iron gate
which is locked, and guarded by two strong and
stalwart Arabs. I say to one of them: “Will you
let me in?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Will you let me out?”</p>

<p>After a long pause, he responds in a deep,
husky voice, “Y-e-s.”</p>

<p>I repeat the question, and receive the same
significant frown and gutteral sound as an answer.
I hardly know what is meant. I do not know but
that the idea is to get me in, and then lock the
gate and exact so much money before letting me
out. I have not “so much money” to give.</p>

<p>Turning to my guide, I say, “Abraham, Abraham,
I charge you by the money I have paid you,
by your sense of honor and manhood; I charge
you by him whose name you bear, let not this
gate close until I come out.”</p>

<p>With an honest emphasis, he responds, “I will
guard the gate.”</p>

<p>Laying my hand upon my companion’s shoulder,
I address him thus: “Johnson, I, to some extent,
commit my life into your keeping. I charge
you by the sacred memory of mother, home and
Heaven, by the golden ties of friendship, I charge
you, Johnson, let not this gate close until I come
out.”</p>

<p>With tears in his eyes, and his great heart welling
without him, he replies: “Whittle, if necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
I will block this gate open with my dead body
until you come out.”</p>

<p>My mind is now made up. I am determined to
enter. You naturally ask, “Why go into such a
place?” I can hardly tell you why, unless forsooth,
I am something like Mamie. Mamie wanted
to go into the garden and see the flowers.
Her mother said, “Well, my child, you may go
into the garden to see the flowers, but you must
not eat any of those berries on the currant-bush.”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, I won’t.”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Mamie emerges from the
garden, licking out her tongue and smacking her
lips, while her face is stained with the berries.</p>

<p>“Did you eat any of those berries, Mamie?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Come, my child, don’t tell me a story.”</p>

<p>Crying and trembling with fear, Mamie says,
“Well, mamma, I did eat a few of ‘em.”</p>

<p>“Why did you disobey mother?”</p>

<p>“Because I couldn’t help it,” was Mamie’s response.</p>

<p>“Why could you not help it?” said the mother.</p>

<p>“‘Cause the devil tempted me.”</p>

<p>Mother. “Why did you not say, ‘Get thee behind
me, Satan’?”</p>

<p>Mamie. “I did say, ‘Get thee behind me, Satan,’
and he got behind me and pushed me right into
the bush.”</p>

<p>So I am tempted, not like Mamie, by one, but
by a half dozen devils. I say: “Get thee behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
me, satans.” At this, some get behind, while
others get before me. The spirit of adventure, or
something else, catches hold of the lapels of my
coat. Now they push and pull and shove and
drag me in, until finally I wake up on the inside
of a living tomb.</p>

<p>Going in some distance from the gate and
around one or two houses, I see a great number
of lepers, lying on the ground, sunning themselves.
A few of the miserable creatures are sitting up.
Seeing me, they make a strange and hideous
noise. This arouses the others.</p>

<p>They rise&mdash;three here, four there, a half dozen,
yea, a dozen, yonder&mdash;still they rise. It looks
almost as if judgment had come; as if the tombs
are opening and the graves are giving up their
dead skeletons. They form a semi-circle about
me. Ah, what a ghastly sight! Men, women and
children in all stages of the leprosy. Some of
them look more like fiends than human beings.
Skin and flesh gone from their hands and arms,
from their brows and cheeks! The working of
their jaw-bones can be seen, as they vainly attempt
to talk.</p>

<p>Here they are&mdash;gums swollen, teeth gone, palates
fallen, one eye, or one ear missing. One
finger&mdash;two fingers&mdash;may be all the fingers gone
from one hand, or, perchance, the hand itself is off
at the wrist, or the arm at the elbow. What arms
and limbs and fingers they have, are frequently
gnarled and twisted like grape-vines. They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
close enough. Rushing my right hand into my
pocket, I strew the coin far and wide like seed
wheat. The poor diseased creatures, with pewter
plates in hand, hobble around here and there as
best they can, pushing and shoving each other
right and left, each trying to get all the coins and
to keep his neighbor from getting any.</p>

<p>Stepping forward, I strew out more coin and
then recede. On come the victims of this loathsome
disease. Oh, what a ghastly sight! Flesh
gone, bones exposed and all twisted out of shape,
great knots protruding from the face and body,
joints decaying and dropping away,&mdash;human beings
coming unjointed and falling to pieces! On
they come, until I find myself half surrounded by
hideous, dreamlike spectres! horrible hobgoblins!
living corpses! walking skeletons! green-eyed
monsters! fiery-eyed fiends! coming up, crowding
up around me, thrusting out their long arms and
bony fingers, apparently eager and anxious to
hug me, like a phantom, to their loathsome and
rotting bosoms!</p>

<p>For the first time in life, I am rooted to the
earth. My blood, like Hamlet’s, is curdled in my
veins. My knees, like the knees of Belshazzar,
smite one against the other. My hair, like the
quills of the fretted porcupine, stands on end.
My mind wanders, my heart sickens, my body
reels, and I stand “like a ruin among ruins, meditating
on decay.” In gesture, as well as in words,
I say: “Avaunt! avaunt! and quit my sight!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Let the earth hide you! Your bones are marrowless;
your blood is cold; and ye have no eyes in
those sightless sockets with which ye do glare
at me!”</p>

<p>I feel that I would give all that I have, or hope
to have, if I could, once for all, blot this awful
scene from my mind. But no; it is there. It is
indelibly stamped upon the landscape of memory.
And often, instead of sleeping soundly, I
will dream about it. I will dream that I am still
in here; that the gate is locked and barred, and
that I am a doomed man; that these decaying
folk have entirely surrounded me, and are intertwining
their arms and limbs with mine, almost
like hissing serpents in the hair!</p>

<p>O, my dying fellow mortal, do you know that
leprosy is typical of sin? How, oh! how, would a
man feel, if, while sitting in his parlor, a half dozen
lepers should come in, reeling and staggering&mdash;falling
to pieces? He would shrink back and call
upon the earth to swallow him, or the mountains
to fall upon and hide him from the face of nature.</p>

<p>How, then, I ask, would God and the angels
feel, if one unconverted soul should enter into
Heaven, into the presence of that God who can
not look upon sin? One sinner, walking the
golden streets, falling to pieces with moral putrefaction,
would cause the redeemed to shudder, the
angels to flee away; at his approach, darkness
would surround the throne and Heaven would be
turned into hell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>But, O friend, my heart thrills with joy akin to
that which the angels feel in Heaven, when I say:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“There is a fountain filled with blood<br />
Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins,<br />
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,<br />
Lose all their guilty stains.”</p>

<p class="p1">So, when the gospel is proclaimed in your hearing,
go not to the Jordan, as Naaman did; but go
fling yourself into that stream opened up in the
house of David for the cleansing of the human
family. After Naaman had dipped in the river,
his skin and flesh grew back as the skin and flesh
of a little child. So you, when you have bathed
yourself in the stream of God’s forgiving mercy,
will be clad in the spotless robes of Christ’s righteousness.
You will be sinless as a little child.
And I am sure the angels will strike their golden
harps, and the music will go ringing and reverberating
adown the aisles of eternity, as they shout,
“Halleluiah, halleluiah, one more sinner redeemed&mdash;washed
in the blood of the Lamb.”</p>

<p class="pch">FROM DAMASCUS TO THE SEA OF GALILEE.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/cap-i.jpg" width="25" height="60" alt=""/>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi08">I HAD not been feeling well for some days and
while at Damascus I was taken ill with varioloid
fever. This was just twelve days after I
was directly exposed to the small-pox and the
cholera. The varioloid, with which I was suffering,
was so severe that my friends really feared it
would develop into small-pox proper. It was
a dark hour for the sufferer. The shadows of
twilight&mdash;the twilight of life, as well as of day,
seemed to be gathering around me. Even then
I could say: “I have lived, and have not lived in
vain: my mind may lose its force, my blood its
fire, and my frame perish even in conquering pain,
but there is that within me which shall tire Torture
and Time, and breathe when I expire.”</p>

<p>One night when I was suffering most intensely,
when my brow was all scorched with fever and
my body racked with pain, Mr. Hamlin, whom I
have already mentioned, and whose income is
more than a dollar an hour, came into my room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
and lay down on the side of the bed. With his
hand on my brow he said: “Whittle, we are fellow
travelers for this journey through the Holy Land;
we are friends for the journey of life, and now that
you are ill, I want to say that you shall have my
sympathy, my presence and my purse. I am your
friend and helper. You may have cholera, small-pox,
or what not, yet I will stand by you to the
last. I shall not leave your bedside until you are
well, or as long as you need a friend.” I said to
myself: “Truly, night bringeth out the stars,” and
“every cloud has a silver lining.” I fell asleep;
the fever cooled off, and in a few days “Richard
was himself again.” Now that it is over, I am
glad that I was ill. It revealed to me the character
of the man with whom I am traveling. It is
not an unpleasant thing, when one is ten or twelve
thousand miles from home, to have a friend talk
to him in that way. Hamlin is a whole-souled
fellow.</p>

<p>The second night after leaving Damascus the
“Equestrian Pilgrims” camped at the foot of
Mount Hermon, whose regal brow was crowned
with purest snow. It was a glorious sight to see
that lonely, lordly mountain, bathed in the golden
splendor of the setting sun. One almost ceases
to wonder that it has become an object of vigorous
adoration. The word Hermon itself means “the
holy,” “the unapproachable.” The Arab word for
Hermon means “the old,” “the grey-bearded,” “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
venerable.” The inspired writers of old often
refer to Hermon. It appears to have formed the
northern boundaries of the children of Israel.
Solomon speaks of Hermon as the haunt of wild
beasts, and strangely enough my guide-book says,
and the natives here confirm the statement, that
bears, wolves and foxes still abound here. The
Psalmist says brotherly love is as pleasant as the
“dew of Hermon;” as the “dew that falleth on
Mount Zion.” I have been much impressed with
heavy dews since coming into this Eastern country.
I have seen the dew falling before the sun
goes down in the evening, and for an hour after
the sun rises in the morning. In this country it
rains six months, and is dry six months. During
the dry season vegetation withers and all nature
suffers for moisture. Every night the falling dew
is like a gentle shower of rain, refreshing the
parched grass and “reviving the vigor of vegetation.”
But for these heavy dews nothing would
grow, and the people could scarcely exist. How
impressive it must have been to these people,
therefore, when David said: “Brotherly love is as
pleasant as the dew of Hermon, as the dew that
falleth on Mount Zion.” God hasten the day
when “brotherly love shall abound:” when men
shall say: “Behold how good and how pleasant it
is for brethren to dwell together in unity.”</p>

<p>Hermon is, in round numbers, ten thousand
feet high and twenty-nine miles long. Its base is
rich, and, for this country, well cultivated. Higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
up it supports several large almond groves, the
fruit of which is most excellent. It is generally
conceded by scholars that one of the slopes of
Hermon was the scene of the Transfiguration.
By some this honor was once claimed for Mount
Tabor, but this idea has been exploded. It is
impossible that Christ should have been Transfigured
on Mount Tabor, for Josephus tells us
that Tabor was at that time crowned with a city,
and we know that the Transfiguration occurred,
not in the midst of human habitations, but out in
the solitude of nature. The last time we see our
blessed Lord before the Transfiguration was at
Caesarea Philippi, near the base of Hermon.
“And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James,
and John, his brother, and bringeth them up into
a high mountain apart and was there transfigured
before them; His face did shine as the sun and
His garment was white as the light. And, behold,
there appeared unto them Moses and Elias, talking
with Him. Then answered Peter and said
unto Jesus: ‘Lord, it is good for us to be here:
if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles&mdash;one
for Thee, one for Moses, and one for Elias.’”</p>

<p>We were high on the slopes of Hermon. It
was to me a sacred place. When the evening
hour came, I stole away from my companions. I
went out all alone “where nought but the gleaming
stars looked down upon me in silence,” where
I could commune with my own heart, with nature
and “nature’s God.” I gave myself up to meditation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and prayer. I said: “Can it be possible that
I am now standing on, or near, the spot where the
divinity of my Lord revealed itself; where He
wrapped Himself with celestial glory as with a
garment; where the veil was drawn aside, and
Peter, James and John caught a glimpse of that
other world and the splendor thereof?” and an
unearthly feeling possessed me&mdash;I verily felt that
I was standing on the Mount of spiritual Transfiguration.
For me the scene was re-enacted before
my eyes. To me the Master’s face did shine
as the sun, and His garment was white as light.
I could almost hear the Father’s voice as He
said: “This is my beloved Son in whom I am
pleased; hear ye Him.” I felt like Peter that I
could say, “It is good to be here;” I felt like
Paul that I was caught up into the third heaven;
I felt like Bunyan that I was standing on the top
of the Delectable Mountains, viewing the City
of God and listening to the music of angels. I
felt like</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,<br />
Swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm,<br />
Around whose base, while rolling clouds are spread,<br />
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.”</p>

<p class="p1">We folded our tents in the morning, to pitch
them at night twenty miles away, by the side of a
flowing fountain, in the midst of an olive grove
and amongst blooming oleanders. There was
beauty, there was poetry, in this place. It was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
sweetly calm and serenely beautiful, that we were
strongly tempted to “lengthen the cords and
strengthen the stakes” of our tents and remain
here a few days. But we were blessed with perfect
weather, and therefore thought best to press
towards “that summer land of the vine and fig
tree.”</p>

<p>Next morning “Amnon,” the reliable, the sure-footed,
was pronounced “ready.” I vaulted into
the saddle and rode away. Evening brought us
to Caesarea Philippi, now called Banias. Little&mdash;practically
nothing&mdash;remains of the stupendous
temple that Herod the Great built here. The
guide-book says, and the pilgrims believe, that
this was the precise place where Christ said:
“Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build
my church.” But turning to Matt. 16:13, I read,
“When Jesus came unto the coasts of Caesarea
Philippi, He asked His Disciples,” etc.</p>

<p>Again, Mark 8:27, “And Jesus went out, and
His disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi,
and by the way He asked His disciples saying:
‘Whom do men say that I am?’” From this we
see that Caesarea Philippi was a district containing
more towns than one. True, this was the
principal city of the district, but no man has the
moral right to select a certain town and say,
“<i>This is the place</i>.” Nor do I care to know the
precise spot. It is enough for me to know that
Peter said: “Thou art the Christ.” Jesus replied:
“Thou art Petra (a rock), and upon this rock I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
will build my church, and the gates of hell shall
not prevail against it.” There is no passage in
all the Bible that is so much discussed as this
one, for this scripture is claimed as the foundation
of the Romish Church. True, the “gates of hell”
have not prevailed against “papal power,” but the
<i>power of God</i> will prevail against it, and the world
shall yet know that Christ, and not Peter, is the
chief “corner stone;” that Christ, and not Mary,
is the sinner’s Savior.</p>

<p>One hour from Banias brings us to the fountain
of the Jordan&mdash;the birth place of the sacred river.
The spring is large, the water deep and beautifully
clear. We could not resist the temptation; we
had to bathe in the “fountain of the gods.” We
could count the pebbles in the bottom of the
swiftly flowing stream. With our eyes we could
follow its windings through the fertile valley, by
noticing the flowers and green bushes fringing its
banks. Near this fountain we rode close upon a
herd of buffaloes before they saw us. There were
twelve in the bunch and a dozen of them got
away&mdash;we killed the others.</p>

<p>We now cross into Galilee. High on the hill,
and before us, as we face the west, is the city of
Dan. O Dan, what a history thou hast had!
What memories gather around thy ancient, thy
venerable head! As thy name indicates, thou
wast once a judge. Thy sons were born to positions
of honor. But Ichabod!&mdash;“thy glory has
departed!” Thou art no longer a sightly city, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
a ruined and disheveled village. Thou no longer
rulest, but art now thyself ruled with a rod of iron.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“There is the moral of all human tales;<br />
’Tis but the same rehearsed of the past,<br />
First Freedom, and then glory&mdash;when that fails,<br />
Wealth, vice, corruption&mdash;barbarism at last!”</p>

<p class="p1">In olden times Dan was an important place&mdash;the
most important city in north Galilee. We
often see the expression, “from Dan to Beersheba,”
which means from the extreme north to the
extreme south of Palestine, a distance of one
hundred and sixty-five miles. “From Dan to
Beersheba” meant to Jews of old just what “from
Maine to Mexico” and “from New York to San
Francisco” means to Americans&mdash;the uttermost
limits of the country.</p>

<p>I give in the following lines an account of a
nocturnal visit that Abraham, the father of the
faithful, made to this city of Dan. “And when
Abram heard that his brother was taken captive,
he armed his trained servants, born in his own
house, three hundred and eighteen, and he pursued
them unto Dan. And he divided himself against
them, he and his servants by night, and smote
them, and pursued into Hobah, which is on the
left hand of Damascus. And he brought back all
the goods, and also his brother Lot and his goods,
and the women also and the people.”</p>

<p>Coming into Galilee, we find ourselves at once
in a beautiful valley lying between two mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
ridges running north and south. The valley is
apparently ten miles wide and fifteen to eighteen
miles long. The soil is as black as a crow and
fertile as the alluvial deposits of the Nile. It is
so rich that it looks as if it would sprout a
shadow&mdash;I am afraid to stand still long in a place.
Only small patches of this fertile valley are cultivated
and these in the most primitive and imperfect
manner. The land is scratched over with
wooden plows, drawn, as I have sometimes seen,
by a donkey and a skeleton of a milk cow yoked
together, or by a camel and an ox harnessed side
by side. Thus they tickle the soil which in turn
smiles with a sickly, sentimental harvest, and the
people live in filth, penury, and poverty; whereas,
if they had western vim and push and shove and
energy, if they had improved implements of agriculture
and would send them deep into the ground
and turn up the soil, “the desert would blossom
as the rose,” and these trifling sons of want would
soon have to “pull down their old barns and build
greater ones.” Peace and plenty would usurp the
place now held by pinching poverty, and Jerusalem
once more would stand</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Girt by her theatre of hills, and would reap<br />
Her corn, and wine, and oil; and plenty would leap<br />
To laughing life, with her redundant horn.”</p>

<p class="p1">Here and there, scattered over the plain, we see
a Bedouin village. Village did I say? Yes, a
village; though there is not a log or a plank, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
board, or a shingle, or a stone to be seen. One
of these villages consists of 300 to 500 Bedouins,
living in 75 to 100 tents huddled together without
law or order. The Bedouins take the bark of the
papyrus plant and plait or weave it (by hand of
course) into a coarse, rough matting with which
they make their houses. The same material serves
as roof, walls and floor. These sons of the
desert hide their nakedness with robes made of
camel’s hair, and their children dress as did Adam
or Eve before fig-leaf dresses came into fashion.</p>

<p>In the southern part of the valley is Lake
Huleh, or the waters of Merom. Some years ago
the plain surrounding this lake was a bloody
battle field. Six or eight kings “went out, they
and all their hosts with them, much people, even
as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude,
with horses and chariots very many. And
when all these kings were met together, they came
and pitched their tents at the waters of Merom to
fight against Israel. And the Lord said unto
Joshua, be not afraid because of them; for to-morrow
I will deliver them up all slain before
Israel; thou shalt hough their horses and burn
their chariots with fire. So Joshua came, and all
the people of war with him, against them by the
waters of Merom suddenly and they fell upon
them. And the Lord delivered them into the
hand of Israel.” Lest some people should suppose
that I witnessed that battle, I will state that
Joshua lived some 1400 years before Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Long before night our tents were stretched on
the shore of the Sea of Galilee. This is the most
hallowed spot to which we have yet come. No
place we have visited is so fraught with holy
memories. Arriving here, I dismounted, went
into my tent, and there for the first time knelt
down and kissed the earth. I knew it was a sacred
place. Around this lake our Blessed Lord
spent most of His public life. Every thing here
wears a holy aspect; every thing is suggestive of
the Savior. When I see the men in their row
boats, toiling at their nets, I am naturally reminded
of the miraculous draught of fishes, of the
worldly occupation of those whom Jesus, walking
on these very shores, called to follow Him, saying:
“I will make you fishers of men.” Probably the
ancestors of these half-clad people before me were
among the “multitude whom Jesus fed with a few
loaves and fishes” on the opposite bank of the
lake, or among that other multitude who thronged
the beach where I now stand, and, pressing the
water’s edge, listened with bated breath to Christ
as He spake from Simon’s boat, built, no doubt,
like these on the lake.</p>

<p>Before me are the sites of three ancient cities
whose very names have become a reproach; and
who can wonder! They rest under the direct curse
of Him who said: “Woe unto thee, Chorazin!
Woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for I say unto you
that in the day of judgment it shall be more tolerable
for Tyre and Sidon than for you, Chorazin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and Bethsaida!&mdash;and thou, Capernaum, which art
exalted unto Heaven, shalt be brought down to
hell.” Yea, truly; Capernaum, the home of Christ,
has been cast down to hell. The city rejected
Christ and ever since that time the curse of God
has rested upon it. A word to the wise is sufficient.
I will therefore only add; reader, be sure
you do not reject Him of whom Moses and the
prophets did write.</p>

<p>Standing on the western edge of the lake, near
the northern end, and looking in a north-westerly
direction, I see, about 300 yards away, a man
plowing with a wooden plow, drawn by a milk cow
and a donkey. In the same field, and close by
the plowman, is another man with a basket on his
arm full of seed corn (wheat) which he is strewing
broadcast over the ground. This reminds me
that once upon a time our Lord was standing on
these shores, near where I now am. A great
multitude of people had assembled to listen to
His gracious words. The press was so great that
our Lord stepped into a little boat and pushed it
out a little way on the water. As the people
stood on the shore Christ sat in the boat and
preached to them. He began His sermon, “The
sower went forth to sow. Some seed fell by the
wayside, some among thorns and some in the
rocks.” This scene was being re-enacted before
my own eyes. How delightful are such experiences!
How it carries one back to ancient days!
This lake furnished the subject for the parable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the net. And on the left are the hills and fields
whence was drawn the comparison to the leaven,
the hidden treasure, the pearl of great price.
Around this lake the lilies grew and the ravens
fed, which the Lord bade us remember.</p>

<p>Galilee is a beautiful lake. It is ten to twelve
miles long and six to eight miles wide. The
rocky walls surrounding the lake rise, in some
places, several hundred feet above its surface.
Most of the country around is rough and barren.
A few fig and other fruit and shade trees grow
near the water’s edge.</p>

<p>But if you would see the beauty&mdash;the poetry of
Galilee, wait until the glare of day has mellowed
into twilight; wait until a holy calm broods over
the lake and its surface has been transformed
into a silver mirror. Then the great stars above
you gleam like nuggets of gold in the blue depths
below. Now go “silently and alone” and walk on
the beach. You find that distance is annihilated.
The lake may be six, sixty, or six hundred miles
wide&mdash;you can not tell&mdash;you do not care. You
are not thinking of time or distance, either. The
beauty of the scene rivets your attention. Sacred
memories crowd upon the mind, and you can but
say: “Oh! Galilee! Galilee! For thousands of
years have thy pure waters been surging against
these historic shores&mdash;these sacred shores. Upon
thy watery surface Jesus did walk, as though it
had been marble pavement. When the storm did
come and thou wert lashed into rage and fury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
when thy waves were tossed like mountains to
the sky; when the frail bark was threatened, and
human life endangered; the Son of God whispered:
‘Peace, be still.’ The winds obeyed Him and
thy waves, O Galilee, crouched at His feet. For
these reasons thou hast become a holy&mdash;a sacred
sea.</p>

<p>“And now I, even I, a humble disciple of that
same Jesus, am permitted to walk on thy shores
and sail on thy waters.”</p>

<p>Being unable to break the chain of fascination
which binds us to this place, we have remained
here several days. Swimming in Galilee is truly
delightful. We have had several messes of fish
from the lake, but as yet we have caught no fish
with a “silver coin in his mouth.”</p>

<p>Tiberias, the only place of importance on the
lake, we find to be a walled city of some 5,000 souls,
the most of whom are Jews. We find much in the
city to attract our attention, but nothing to excite
admiration. The Jews living here are a reproach
to their race. They are as sorry looking specimens
of humanity as one can reasonably expect
to find this side of the grave. They are as filthy
as monkeys, ugly as gorillas and as poor as Job’s
turkey. Extravagant expressions are usually out
of place, but I am honestly of the opinion that
these people are as poor as a church mouse or a
Baptist preacher.</p>

<p>Most of our time here has been spent, not in
Tiberias, but in visiting the mouth of Jordan and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
some ruined cities around the lake, in sailing,
swimming and fishing, in reading the Bible and
talking of Christ, its central figure.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi12">FROM Tiberias to Nazareth is a seven hours’
journey. Our way lies across a rocky, hilly
country. The sun is hot. The heat seems
to have positive weight. Icarus would not have
had to soar very high beneath this fierce sun,
before his “waxen wings” would have “melted”
and let him down with a crash. The reflection
from the rocks is almost like the hot breath of a
furnace.</p>

<p>Look! yonder to the right, and not far away,
are eight or ten gazelles dashing down the steep
hillside. Their tongues are lolling out; they have
been up on the elevated table-lands, and now, dry,
hot, and thirsty, they are making their way to the
Sea of Galilee. How swift they go! And yet
Asahel, we are told, was “as light of foot as a wild
gazelle.” The men of Gad, who swam the swollen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
river to join King David, had the “faces of lions”
and the “feet of gazelles.” Isaiah, when speaking
of the beauty of Babylon, could bestow no higher
praise than to say: “She is as the gazelle of
kingdoms.” Solomon says: “My beloved is as
beautiful as a gazelle leaping up the mountains,
skipping upon the hills.” To see this swift-footed
animal, going with parched lips to the sea, reminds
one of the Psalmist’s earnest words: “As the
hart (the gazelle) panteth after the water brooks,
so panteth my soul after thee, O God. My soul
thirsteth for God, for the living God.”</p>

<p>The Arab word “gazelle” is not used in the
Bible, yet it is generally understood that the
“roebuck” of Scripture is the same animal. They
are plentiful here, and may be found in all sparsely
settled sections of the country. South of Hebron
they are sometimes seen in droves of from fifty to
a hundred. They are not so large, but are otherwise
very much like our American deer. Their
flesh, like the antelope and venison of America, is
considered delicious, and the Nimrods of to-day
are constantly on their track. The gazelle, however,
having a swift foot and a keen eye, is seldom
hung up before an Arab’s fire.</p>

<p>We are now upon what is thought to be the
corn-field referred to in Matthew 12:1. “And at
that time Jesus went on the Sabbath day through
the corn, and His disciples, who were an hungered,
began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.” The
field is still worked and it will soon be seed-time
again. The corn referred to was of course wheat,
as our Indian corn was not then, and is not now,
known to Eastern people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>After five hours and a half in this scorching
sun, we are thoroughly prepared to appreciate the
grateful shade of the great olive and palm trees
under which we are now resting. We are in
Cana, of Galilee, whose history is sacred and
whose name is familiar to all Bible readers. Yes,
here on this rough, rocky hillside, is Kefr Kenna&mdash;the
village of Cana&mdash;where Jesus made wine
of water. Few passages of Scripture impress me
more than the account of this wedding feast. I
read, “And the third day there was a marriage in
Cana, of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was
there, and both Jesus and His disciples were called
to the marriage.” It was during this wedding
feast that Christ turned water into wine. “This
beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana, of Galilee,
and manifested forth His glory, and His disciples
believed on Him.” Christ’s first miracle,
wrought at the beginning of His public career,
was, we see, turning water into <i>wine</i>. And the
night before His crucifixion, He took <i>wine</i> and
said: “This is my blood,” and “without the shedding
of blood there is no remission.” I see
a significance, therefore, in the fact that the first
miracle was making wine. That miracle was
prophetic. It pointed to something yet to come.
That miracle was, in Christ’s thought, closely
connected with the Cross and Man’s Redemption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Having finished the account of the wedding-feast,
the evangelist continues: “After this He
went down to Capernaum (about five hours’
walk); He, and His mother and His brethren and
His disciples.” Jesus had already taken up His
abode in Capernaum. Probably Mary had never
been there. It is quite probable, also, that Christ
had not seen her for some time. It may be that
the hope of meeting her son was the main thing
that induced her to attend the wedding. Her
hope was realized. What a joyful meeting that
must have been! Somehow I love my Savior
more, because He loved His Mother so well.
How beautiful this is: after the wedding is over
Jesus goes back to Capernaum, <i>taking His Mother
with Him</i>. She wanted to see how her “preacher-boy”
was situated in His new home by the sea.
No doubt when they reached Capernaum, at the
north end of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus took His
Mother up on the flat-roofed house and pointed
out different places of interest.</p>

<p>At present, Cana is of little importance and is
not at all inviting. Large beds of tall, thorny
cactus plants are everywhere to be seen. The
houses of the village are few in number, and rude
of structure. Here, as elsewhere in this country,
the people are filthy, ignorant and half naked.
The two best houses in the place are convents;
one belonging to the Roman and the other to the
Greek Catholics. We now visit these convents
in the order named. Clad in a black gown, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
a rosary fastened around his waist and hanging
from his side, the Latin Priest approaches us,
invites us in, and kindly shows us through his
convent. He rehearses the history of Cana, and
speaks of the wedding that Jesus attended as
though it had taken place only yesterday. We
come now to the sacred chamber; the Priest
pauses; he is deeply moved (?). With tears in
his eyes and pathos in his words he says: “In this
room the marriage occurred. Just there, ‘pointing
to the side of the room opposite him,’ just
there the wedding couple stood. Christ, Mary,
and John stood here on my right, while the other
guests occupied the portion of the room to my
left. Just here, where I am, stood the Catholic
priest who pronounced the wedding ceremony.
Here, gentlemen,” the good priest continued, “here
are some of the identical water pots that our
Lord used in making wine. Yes, sirs, these are
the veritable water-pots that Jesus used. Come
up here and handle them and see for yourselves.”
We express no doubt and I suppose we really
appear somewhat credulous. The superstitious
priest now becomes enthusiastic. “There were,”
he says, “originally six of these jars or pots; but
one was broken, one we sent to Jerusalem, one to
Rome, and here are the other three. Come, come,
and handle them yourselves that you may tell
your friends when you get home.”</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">PRIEST OF THE GREEK CHURCH.</p>

<p>As soon as we get out of the door, Johnson,
with his characteristic sense of humor, touched
me in the side and said: “Chestnuts! Chestnuts!!”
At this moment a short, heavy-built, broad-shouldered,
bushy-headed Greek monk, wearing a hat
whose broad, board-like brim was at the top of
the crown instead of the bottom, comes up to us.
He introduces himself, and after a few words says:
“Now, gentlemen, please come with me. I have
something of very great interest to show you.”
He leads us into, and conducts us through, the
Greek convent, reciting and explaining the history
of the village as we go along. He shows us into
a large room whose walls are lined with pictures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
The Greek pauses, uncovers his head, strikes an
attitude; sorrow seizes his soul, a heavenly look
settles on his troubled face. With noiseless step
and slow, he approaches us and whispers: “The
wedding that we read about in the Bible occurred
in this very room. Yes, gentlemen, this is a
sacred place&mdash;this is where the marriage was solemnized.
Christ, with His Mother and disciples,
stood on the left, the other guests on the right.
The wedding couple stood there in the centre,
and the Greek priest who married them stood
here.” Johnson is dumb as an oyster. But I
have to speak&mdash;I can hold in no longer. I say:
“Did Jesus attend two weddings in this place?”
“No, sir; only one, sir, only one!” “Well,” I
continue, “I was a few minutes ago in the Latin
convent and the Romish priest told me that the
wedding took place there, and now you tell me
that it occurred here. How about that, sir; how
can you explain this?” “The explanation, the
explanation, sir, is very easy. It is simply this:
the other priest lied! Yes, sir, he lied&mdash;only one
wedding here, and that one took place in this
room. And here are the identical water-pots that
He used&mdash;these are the very jars that held the
water which was turned into wine.”</p>

<p>I speak of this at length to bring out an important
fact. On almost every sacred spot in
Palestine, wherever Jesus lived or spent the night,
wherever He preached a sermon, or wrought a
miracle, there we find two convents&mdash;one Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
and one Greek. Each claims to stand upon the
exact spot where such and such a thing occurred.
Occasionally the two convents are some distance
apart; again they stand hard by each other. As
one might naturally suppose, this engenders strife,
and provokes jealousy among the priests, and
greatly perplexes most travelers. But all this
confusion among the priests does not trouble me
for a moment. What do I care whether the marriage
occurred here or there? I know full well
that I am in Cana. I know it is a sacred place.
I know that Christ, with His presence, sanctioned
in Cana what God, in His wisdom, instituted in
Eden&mdash;the marriage relation, which has come
along down the ages, elevating man, purifying
society, strengthening the State and honoring
God. The wisdom of this law strongly argues
its divine origin. I have traveled in many countries,
among many nations, kindreds, tribes and
peoples; and I have never yet traveled in a
country where the Bible was a sealed book, where
God’s law of marriage was unknown or disregarded,
but that the women of that country were in a
low, vile, degraded and servile condition! In such
places woman is regarded as man’s inferior; she
is neglected, imposed upon and down-trodden;
hers is a life of shame and drudgery; she is man’s
burden-bearer and nothing more! In Palestine,
and some other countries where I have traveled,
it is considered a disgrace for a mother to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
birth to a female child! and for this cause men
frequently ill-treat and forsake their wives!</p>

<p>And on the other hand, I have never been in
any land where the Bible was known and read,
where God was worshipped, and His law obeyed,
but that woman was loved and honored and elevated
to her true position in the family and in
society. The Bible teaches that woman was
taken, not from man’s heel that he might trample
upon her, not from his head that she might rule
him with a rod of iron, but from his side that
she might walk beside him&mdash;that she might be his
companion; perchance from his right side, that
his strong right arm might lift her burdens and
fight her battles; or, forsooth, from his left side,
near his heart, that he might love and sympathize
with her. Blessed Bible! thou hast shattered
woman’s shackles; thou hast brought the aureole
of glory, and placed it upon woman’s matronly
brow!</p>

<p>One hour from Cana brings us to a scene of
greater interest. The day is far spent when my
eyes fall for the first time upon Nazareth, nestling
on the sunny slope of a high hill which gracefully
swings itself around and forms something of a
horseshoe. The city, situated near the centre of
this curvature, is built partly in the valley and
partly on the hillside. The lower part of the city
is half hidden amid a rich profusion of pomegranates,
orange trees, olive groves and vineyards.
“Jack Frost” has brought no tidings of autumn;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
consequently the leaves are still green and the
luscious fruits are still hanging upon the boughs
of the trees.</p>

<p>Leaving the hilltop we come down into the
valley, and pitch our tents under some large
orange trees on the edge of the city. Oh, what a
privilege it is to be here! Nazareth is a holy city.
It was the childhood home of the Savior. Here
is where Luke says “He was brought up.” Again,
“And when they had performed all things according
to the law of the Lord, they returned unto
Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. And the
child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
And He went down with them and came to
Nazareth, and was subject unto them; but His
mother kept all these sayings in her heart. And
Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in
favor with God and man.” Dutiful child! Model
son! A mother would naturally keep such a boy,
as well as his “sayings, in her heart.” No doubt
He, in childish glee often played with other children,
only He never lost His temper. He never
got angry and called His playmates hard and ugly
names. He was always kind and gentle; consequently
all His acquaintances and fellow playmates
liked Him, and the more they saw of Him
the more they loved Him; for we are told “He
<i>grew</i> in favor with God and man.” We are only
human; and yet, with God’s help, it is possible for
us so to conduct ourselves that we, like Jesus,
may grow in wisdom and in favor with God
and man.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">VALE AND CITY OF NAZARETH.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, Nazareth was the home of Christ. Here
He played, here He worked, here He studied Nature
in all its loveliness and manifold beauty.
One who visits Nazareth can well imagine that in
spring-time Jesus would pluck the rose-buds and
orange blossoms, and weave them into bouquets
for His mother. We know He loved flowers. He
was so fond of them that the betrayer knew where
to find Him at the evening hour. It was he who
said: “Consider the lilies of the field; they toil
not, neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you
that Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed
like one of these.”</p>

<p>Knowing as we do His fondness for solitude,
nothing is more natural than to suppose that the
youthful Christ would often forsake the busy
scenes of street-life and climb to the top of the
hill back of the city. In the valley He had studied
nature and human nature; on the mountain He
could study God and revelation. From here His
view of the country was something like the catechism
definition of infinitude&mdash;“without bounds or
limits.” Here, seated on a rock, leaning against
an olive tree, with the old Hebrew Bible unrolled
on His lap, He could read and think and plan to
His heart’s content. Here He could read about
almost any event, whatsoever, and at once lift His
eyes from the parchment and let them fall upon
the spot where the scene took place. Did He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
read of the fish swallowing Jonah, He could look
out upon the heaving bosom of the Mediterranean,
flecked with white-winged ships, some of
them no doubt bound for Tarshish. Did He
read about Elijah praying for rain, there was
Mt. Carmel projecting into the sea and standing
out in such bold relief that one could almost see
a man standing on its summit. Did He read
from the parchment of Elijah’s contest with the
priests of Baal, He could look there at the base of
Carmel where the altars were built. Looking to
the north, He could see Mt. Hermon where a few
years later He was to be transfigured, and was to
meet Moses and Elias from the other world. In
the same direction was the hill where He was to
preach a sermon to a great multitude; there, also,
and not far away, was Cana where His first
miracle was to be wrought. Eastward, He could
see around the Sea of Galilee, where He was to
make His future home, and where He was to do
“most of His mighty works.” With His face still
to the east, He could see Mt. Tabor, six miles
distant, rising up like a sugar-loaf to the height of
two thousand two hundred feet. Seeing this, He
would naturally read of Deborah and Barak with
an army of ten thousand men on Tabor while
Sisera, with an armed host including nine hundred
chariots of war, stood at the base of the mountain.
Just south of Nazareth is the broad and fertile
plain of Esdraelon, which has been the “battle-ground
of the nations.” From the hilltop behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Nazareth, Christ could see, flowing through the
midst of this plain, the river Kishon, whose swift
and swollen current swept so many of Sisera’s
men on to the “Great Sea” and to death. Beyond
this plain He could see Nain where He, in
after life, was to raise the widow’s son. Near
Nain is Endor, where Saul called up the witch
by night. There, also, are the heights of Gilboa,
where the same King breathed his last. There,
too, is Shunem, where Elisha often spent the night;
and Jezreel, where Jezebel, the wicked Queen, was
flung from the upper window of the palace, and
dashed to death upon the stone pavement below.</p>

<p>I am standing upon this same hilltop with an
open Bible in my hand. As I read of these different
incidents, and then look from place to place
where the different scenes occurred, I am deeply
moved. These several passages seem to sink into
my heart. I am not surprised that Jesus knew
the Scriptures so perfectly. This was the best
place in all the world for Him to have been
brought up. Surely these valleys were spread
out, and these hills lifted up to form a fit play-ground
and a suitable school-room for the Royal
Child.</p>

<p>It was from a high bluff, on this mountain also,
that the heartless populace, who rejected Christ’s
teaching, tried to “cast Him down headlong. But
He, passing through the midst of them, went His
way.” To be thrown from this cliff, one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
fall a hundred and twenty or thirty feet before
striking the jagged rocks below.</p>

<p>Tradition still points out the place where Joseph
and Mary lived. It is a plain, simple grotto,
hewn in the side of the hill near the city. Joseph’s
carpenter-shop is also shown, and some work is
still done in that shop. Of course one is to use
his own judgment as to how much or how little of
these traditions he will believe. The spring, the
only water supply of the town, is called “Mary’s
Fountain,” “The Virgin’s Fountain” and “The
Fountain of the Queen.” During all hours of the
day, and far into the night, one sees scores and
scores of women and children, with their jugs and
goat-skins, crowding around the spring for water.</p>

<p>It is a great privilege to be here and see these
things that were once so familiar to the Savior;
to mingle and talk with these people who live and
dress and think now, just as their ancestors did in
the time of Christ. Of course they crowded
around this fountain then just as they do to-day,
and no doubt He often came with His mother to
this same spring for water. Being here and seeing
these things is almost like being introduced into
the family circle, and becoming acquainted with
the home life of Jesus.</p>

<p>At present Nazareth has 10,000 or 12,000 inhabitants.
The houses, with a few exceptions, are
small, ancient and forbidding in appearance. The
narrow streets are crooked, and filthy in the extreme.
The people have little or nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
recommend them to the traveler. When one
views this aspect of the city, one is naturally reminded
of Nathaniel’s question: “Can any good
thing come out of Nazareth?”</p>

<p>The English and Presbyterian churches have
missions here. The former is in a flourishing condition,
but the latter is at a stand-still because of
some trouble with the Turkish government. The
English have an Orphans’ Home here in which
they feed, clothe, and educate one hundred orphan
girls&mdash;as some go out others come in. Some of
these girls are almost grown, and many of them
are bright and beautiful. I have just had the
sweet privilege of preaching to them. Oh, how it
stirs one’s heart to stand here in Nazareth and
preach! to stand here where <i>Jesus was brought
up</i>, and preach <i>His gospel</i> to <i>His people</i>&mdash;the
Jews! After preaching I sang several songs for
the people. In turn, the orphan girls in a sweet
tone of voice sang for me a beautiful song which
touched me deeply, and which I have translated,
that the reader may also enjoy it.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">NOTHING could present a scene more characteristic
of Oriental life than a half dozen
shepherd tents, black and dingy, pitched,
not like Jacob’s tent on the mountain top, but
like Isaac’s tent in the valley, in the midst of an
olive grove, by the side of a flowing fountain.
Here by the tents is a corral, or sheep-cote, enclosed
by a rock wall, on top of which is a rough
hedge of dry, thorny bushes, placed there to keep
the robbers, as well as the jackals and wolves and
other wild beasts, from molesting the sheep.</p>

<p>Many flocks, both of sheep and goats, are
brought to this one cote for protection during the
night, and the swarthy shepherds, each with a
loose garment of coarse camel’s hair carelessly
thrown around him to hide his nakedness, occupy
the tents in common.</p>

<p>Just across the ravine, on the opposite hillside,
is a rough stone house eight or ten feet high with
a low, flat roof. This is a “Kahn,” or an inn&mdash;a
kind of lodging house to accommodate caravans
which are always passing between Egypt, Jerusalem,
Damascus, Palmyra and Bagdad.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>From an hour before the sun goes down, until
eight o’clock at night, one can see caravan after
caravan of camels&mdash;sometimes a string of them a
half mile long&mdash;coming across the hills, laden
with wines, carpets, dried fruits, hand-made silks,
Persian carpets, and all manner of Oriental merchandise.
Slowly, but patiently, these “ships of
the desert” move on beneath their immense cargo
of freight. One caravan after another comes in,
until from 100 to 200 camels may be seen around
one Kahn. The burdens are removed, the several
merchants putting their goods in separate piles.
The ships are anchored. The tired brutes lie
down and are fed. The merchants and camel-drivers
gather round the fire, seating themselves
on the ground, folding their limbs up under them
as though they had no bones in them.</p>

<p>Beans, peas, dates, olives, mutton or kid&mdash;and
sometimes both&mdash;are put into one pot and all
boiled together. When it is done, as many of
these hard-featured, grim-visaged, wrinkled-browed,
shaggy-haired Arabs as can, huddle around
one bowl. They have no knives or forks. Sometimes
you see a wooden spoon, but usually they
thrust their horny hands into the bowl, and then
cram their fists into their countenances&mdash;they are
the most open-countenanced people I ever saw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
They are the most ravenous eaters I ever saw.
My dragoman offered to bet ten dollars that one
Arab could drink a quart of coffee, eat a roast
turkey, two loaves of bread, and three pounds of
rice at one meal! And I am quite sure that one
who is acquainted with an Arab’s capacity for
stuffing will never make a wager like that.</p>

<p>The meal being over, a certain weed, used as
tobacco, is brought out and smoking is indulged
in. Now the shepherds across the branch, with
their reed pipes strike up a plaintive tune which
floats over the valley and echoes from the distant
hills. It strikes also a responsive chord in the
hearts of the merchants and camel-drivers. They
now bring out their rude instruments of music,
and play and sing, chant and dance, for hours,
much after the order of wild Indians. In their
ideas of dress and propriety, in their customs and
habits of life generally, these children of the desert
are as primitive, as rude and uncultivated, as were
their fathers 4000 years ago.</p>

<p>When they wake in the morning there is great
stir, bustle and confusion. As the merchants
curse the camel-drivers, they in turn curse and
fight each other, and beat the camels. From the
noise made one would think that two great armies
had met in deadly combat. They slap and beat
and kick each other around like madmen&mdash;I had
almost said “like fiends!” They sometimes put
as much on one camel as two or three ought to
carry. The poor, faithful brutes can not speak
audibly, but as these double burdens are placed
upon them, they lie on the ground and bellow in
a most pathetic manner. The pitiable cries of
the dumb brutes are almost enough to move the
surrounding stones to tears, and yet the heartless
Arab is untouched. The more the camels bellow,
the more their masters beat them with sticks, and
prick them with sharp spears. Finally the ships
are loaded, and soon you see them strung out
across the hills, some going south to Egypt, others
going north to Damascus and Beyrout, or east to
Palmyra and Bagdad.</p>

<p>As often as one sees a night like this, and especially
when one sees it near Dothan (the city
of two wells), he thinks of the time when Jacob’s
sons stripped Joseph of his coat of many colors,
and cast him into the dry pit. And while yet on
the plain of Dothan “they lifted up their eyes and
beheld a company of Ishmaelites, with camels,
going down to Egypt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then there passed by
Midianites, merchant-men, and they drew and
lifted Joseph out of the pit, and sold him to the
Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver, and they
brought Joseph into Egypt.” Around me now are
many money-loving Mohammedans, many cunning
and crafty Jews, who, I think, would willingly
sell their younger brothers for twenty pieces of
silver, or ten pieces either. Yea, I have seen men
in this country, and in my own country, too, who
would gladly sell their souls for money. As in
Joseph’s day, so in ours, “the love of money is
the root of all evil.”</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">AN ANCIENT SHEEP FOLD.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Let us now return to the camp where the merchant-men
spent the night. I spoke of the shepherds,
of their tents and flocks. The herds, both
sheep and goats, of different shepherds have been
housed during the night in the same fold. At
dawn of day the shepherds awake, and, unlike the
thief and robber who climb up over the wall, they
enter in by the door. Each shepherd putteth
forth his own flock, counting them as they pass
slowly out under his rod through the one doorway.
As they pass out, the sheep and the goats
are separated&mdash;the one being turned to the right
hand, the other to the left. “Each shepherd calleth
his sheep by name and leadeth them out. He
goeth before them and his sheep follow him, for
they know his voice.” The sheep string one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
behind another, and as the shepherd, with his
sling and leathern pouch filled with stones strapped
about his shoulders, with a crook in one hand
and a reed pipe in the other, leads his trusting
flock out into the “green pastures and beside the
still waters,” he makes the welkin ring with his
simple, artless melodies. Who could behold a
scene like this without thinking of that robust
shepherd lad who killed Goliath with his sling,
and charmed Saul with his music? Yes, it was
among the sheep, here on these purple hills of
Judea, that David, the sweet singer of Israel, first
learned those Hebrew melodies that have been
sung around the world!</p>

<p>I have several times, on beautiful moonlight
nights, seen shepherds out in the fields with their
flocks under the star-lit sky. It must have been
at a time like this that with upturned face David
said: “When I consider thy heavens, the work of
thy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou
hast ordained; what is man that thou art mindful
of him? and the son of man that thou visitest
him?”</p>

<p>How forcibly does this remind one of the time
when the angelic host undulated above the plains
of Bethlehem crying: “Glory to God in the highest;
on earth, peace and good will to men.” This
has been a different world ever since that song
fell upon the drowsy ear of night.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi08">I READ in my Bible that a certain man went
down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell
among thieves. When this announcement
was made, I am sure that every ear was all attention,
for the people naturally expected some
startling revelation to follow. And why? Because
the way was then, and is now, lined with thieves,
insomuch that it would be impossible, to-day for
any Frank (Arabs call white men Franks) to go
unprotected from Jerusalem to Jericho without
falling among thieves. This danger is recognized
to such an extent that the government (the Turkish
government of course) keeps a garrison of
Turkish soldiers in Jerusalem, whose sole business
is to conduct tourists to Jericho, to the Jordan,
and over into Arabia. And the tourist is compelled
to employ these government guards. Oh
well, you are not legally bound, but if you go on
this trip without these extra guards, and are killed
on the way, you are not allowed to sue the government.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
But if you take the guards, and are killed,
after you are buried you may sue the government
twice, if you like. I am not easily frightened,
myself, but I took the guards on Johnson’s account,
for I saw plainly he did not want to die
here. I honestly believe that it would almost kill
Johnson to die anywhere! So with four government
guards, all well-equipped with broad-swords,
bowie-knives, and javelins, and all splendidly
mounted, we start off for an Eastern trip.</p>

<p>As we cross the Mount of Olives, a sacred feeling
comes over us, for we know that every foot of
this road was once familiar to our Divine Lord.
It was here He prayed in the garden. It was here
He was betrayed with a kiss. It was on this
Mountain He cursed the fruitless fig-tree. It was
from here, also, that He beheld and wept over the
sinful city. Passing over the brow of Olivet, we
come, on its eastern slope, to that sweet little
village where Jesus often spent the night. Here
He wept with the sisters who wept, and raised the
brother who was dead. Ah! blessed household
was that where Mary and Martha and Lazarus
lived. Blessed household is that to-day, whose
spiritual atmosphere is attractive to the Son of
God. Oh, what a joyous time there must have
been with those two sisters and their brother&mdash;“when
the Lord to Bethany came!” Darkness
fled at His approach. The shadows lifted when
He came. O gentle reader, make your home a
Bethany, and Jesus, who forsook the city for a
quiet, country village, will take up His abode
with you! He will weep with you when you weep.
He will revive your hopes when they are buried.</p>

<p>Continuing our journey eastward, we soon find
ourselves in a deep and narrow ravine. The
floor of this wady, or ravine, is twelve or fifteen
feet wide, while its rocky sides lift themselves up
very steeply for three or four hundred feet, getting
wider and yet wider towards the top. I now
turn to my Bible, and find that once upon a time
David ruled and reigned in Jerusalem. But Absalom
rebelled against his father and drove the
King from the city. Fleeing towards Jericho,
David passed through this ravine. Then Shimei,
one of Absalom’s servants, who was also one of
the household of Saul, ran along on the edge of
the precipice and cursed David, and rolled great
stones down the steep bluff, trying to kill him,
saying to him: “Come out, come out, thou bloody
man, and thou man of Belial!”</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">AN ARAB HORSEMAN.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Passing on through this historic wady, we come
now to where it opens wide its broad arms and
forms a splendid valley of a hundred acres or
more. “Halt! Halt!” cries one of the guards.
“Halt!” Every horse is motionless. Every man
is seized with terror. We expect the robbers to
attack us at any moment. But we soon dismiss
all hope on that line, for we see we are to be deprived
of that privilege. Our guards simply want
to exhibit to us their splendid feats of horsemanship.
And ah me! how graceful they are. Each
rider seems a part of his Arab horse. The guards
rush at, and fight each other, to show us how
skilled they are in this method of warfare, and
how impossible it would be for us to resist, or escape
from an attacking party of Bedouins. Each
horse feels his keeping. He moves like a bundle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of steel springs. It seems that he will leave the
earth and fly through the air. These superb
horses remind us of the beautiful story we have
all read in the Arabian Nights, about those splendid
Arabian mares that used to prance through
the streets of Damascus, until break of day, and
“then fly away towards Bagdad on enchanted
carpets.”</p>

<p>Leaving here, the way is so rough that I can
but say to my companions: “Pull off your coats,
boys, pull off your coats, and roll up your sleeves,
‘for Jordan am a hard road to trabble.’” No
saying was ever more true: <i>Jordan am a hard
road to travel</i>!</p>

<p>We are now stopped for luncheon at a Kahn,
or inn, half way from Jerusalem to Jericho, about
eleven miles from either place. Once more I
read in my Bible that a certain man went down
from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves.
The thieves beat the man, dragged him out to
one side of the road, and left him for dead. But
the Good Samaritan came along, took the poor
Jew who had been beaten, put him on his donkey
and carried him to an inn, and paid the inn-keeper
to take care of him. Now, reader, what will you
think when I tell you that I suppose I am stopping
at the same inn where the Good Samaritan
left the unfortunate Jew? Let me take you into
my confidence and tell you why I think so. The
road from Jerusalem to Jericho is the same now
that it was 2,000 years ago. We know this from
the remains of the old Roman aqueduct along the
roadside. There is only one fountain on this
road, and that one is close by this Kahn. I take
it that every Kahn, or hotel, must, of necessity, be
built near some fountain. Now if the road was
the same in our Lord’s time as it is to-day, and if
then, as now, there was only one fountain on the
way, and if the inn, or Kahn, spoken of in the
Bible was built by a fountain, then we are forced
to the conclusion that it was near the spring from
which we have just drunk.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>Be this as it may, we can not tarry here; we
must continue our eastward journey. About an
hour after leaving the inn of Good Samaritan
fame, we see several half-naked, ill-favored, hard-featured,
cadaverous-looking Bedouins on the hillsides
near the road. They are Brigands, highwaymen,
and their very appearance is enough to
make a civilized man shudder. They are wearing
sandals. Their legs are wrapped with straw and
bark of trees, which is tied on with rawhide
strings. They have coarse, filthy clothes loosely
drawn around the lower part of their bodies.
Their arms and breasts and chins and cheeks are
tattooed in figures of eagles and serpents and
wild beasts. They are tall, lean, swarthy, snuff-colored,
grim-visaged, wrinkled-browed, shaggy-haired,
and fiery-eyed. Around each one is a
leathern girdle, looped here and there with gay
colored ribbons or rags. Each belt holds a
bowie-knife and two horse-pistols, and supports a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
broad-sword suspended from it. In one hand
the Brigand holds a javelin, while the other grasps
a long, single-barreled, flint-and-steel shot-gun.
They live in the clefts of the rocks&mdash;in the dens
and caves of the earth, and the cave-scent clings
to them still.</p>

<p>These are the robbers against whom we have to
be protected. They are numerous along this
route, and I repeat that without the government
guards it would be impossible to escape them.
And yet our guards are a part and parcel of the
same clan, who would have robbed us if we had
not employed them. We pay the guards so much,
and it is a fact that they divide spoils with the
Brigands! It is a kind of division of labor. The
robbers infest the road, making the way dangerous,
so that travelers will be compelled to employ
protectors, and then the protectors and robbers
share and share alike in the profits of the business.
It is strange, and yet as true as strange,
that the government itself is in league with highwaymen!
A certain sheik, here, pays the Turkish
government so much money each year for the
privilege of robbing travelers! If Peter the Hermit
could come forth from his tomb, he would
speak these words in Europe: “where hearing
would hatch them.” I am sure that his words
against the Turkish government would “murder
as they fell.” This is enough to arouse another
“Crusade for Freedom in Freedom’s Holy Land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>”
“How long, O Cataline, wilt thou thus continue to
abuse our patience!”</p>

<p>The country has been dreary and the road
rough from the beginning of the journey, but it
grows worse as we continue. We now see nothing
but a succession of deep gorges, stony ridges,
and rocky peaks. Imagine a thousand tea-cups
turned bottom upwards, separated by a thousand
deep wadys and narrow ravines, the cups, some of
them, rising to the height of several hundred feet,
and the yawning chasms sinking to an enormous
depth, and you have a picture of what now greets
my eyes. I suppose that this mountain side once
supported a luxuriant forest, and that afterwards
it rewarded the yeoman’s toil with abundant harvests.
But ages ago the hillside ditches were
neglected; hence gutters were formed, the soil
was washed off, fertility gave way to barrenness,
beauty to deformity. Of course the ravines have
from age to age washed deeper and deeper, until
now nothing is left but deep, winding chasms, bare
and desolate hills. The road winds around here
and there like a serpent. Now it hangs high on
the bluff upon a narrow shelf of rock, which projects
over the valley. Johnson and Hamlin dismount.
They know that one false step would
dash them to death. With more of daring than
wisdom I shout to them:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“I wish your horses swift and sure of foot.<br />
And so I do commend you to their backs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>We now descend into the valley, only to rise again,
and skirt along the bluff where the narrow road
is cut into the rock.</p>

<p>But, praise the Lord, perilous places are past,
and the scene changes. We pass out of the
Wady Kelt, and lo, the broad valley, the sacred
river, and the Salt Sea burst upon our vision!
These things within themselves are not so attractive
to the eye, but, compared with the hill-country
behind us, they are as beautiful as “apples
of gold in baskets of silver.” For ten miles
above the Dead Sea the Jordan valley is fourteen
miles wide, and is divided by the river which flows
through its centre. This part of the valley west
of the river is called the Plain of Jericho, while
that portion beyond the river is known as the
Plain of Moab. So the valley, practically level,
stretches out for seven miles on either side of the
river. Then on either side of the river, seven
miles from it, and parallel with it, there rises up
a frowning wall of rock whose savage grandeur
might well typify ruin and desolation. For ages
the winter torrents have been coursing down their
sides, until now they are seamed and furrowed, cut
and scarred in every possible manner, and the
mountains seem to writhe in pain and agony!</p>

<p>But we have left the hills. We are now in the
valley, and here before us, seven miles from the
river, at the edge of the plain and at the base of
the mountain, stands Jericho, old hoary-headed
Jericho&mdash;“The City of Palm Trees.” She is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
venerable, indeed! It was Jericho that Moses
looked down upon from the heights of Nebo. It
was Jericho that furnished shelter to the “young
men” who came from Israel’s camp to “spy out
the country.” It was Jericho that Joshua first
attacked “after crossing over the Jordan.” Her
fortifications then were strong, her walls high.
Her people thought “Our castle’s strength will
laugh a siege to scorn.” But the bold spirit of
Joshua was undaunted. It was God’s to command
and his to obey. He surrounded the city.
He sounded the tocsin. The walls fell! Now,
reader, let us realize that when God commands
you or me to do anything, we should move forward
though confronted by walls of adamant!
What is opposition to us? We move in obedience
to the behest of Him who could besiege a
city with “trumps of Joshua,” and route a host
with the “lamps of Gideon!”</p>

<p>After Joshua’s day, Herod the Great rebuilt the
city on a grander scale than ever. Stately castles
were erected, marble palaces arose on every hand.
Great wealth was lavished upon the city. She
was robed in rich apparel and decked with “rubies
rare.” Here Herod held high carnival. Here he
ruled and reveled, and</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“All went merry as a marriage Bell.”</p>

<p class="p1">But Time has dealt harshly with Jericho.
Fickle Fortune has played her false. She has
passed through all the vicissitudes of fortune.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Iron-fingered Fate has torn off her royal robes,
and she sits to-day clad in sackcloth and ashes.
“Gray lizards, those heirs of ruin, of sepulchres,
and desolation, glide in and out among the rocks,
or lie still and sun themselves. Where prosperity
has reigned and fallen; where glory has flamed
and gone out; where beauty has dwelt and passed
away; where gladness was, and sorrow is; where
the pomp of life has been, and silence and death
brood in high places,&mdash;there this reptile makes
his home and mocks at human vanity. His coat
is the color of ashes, and ashes are the symbol of
hopes that have perished; of aspirations that
have come to naught; of loves that are buried.
If he could speak he would say, ‘Build temples: I
will lord it in their ruins; build palaces: I will
inhabit them; erect empires: I will inherit them;
bury your beautiful: I will watch the worms at
their work; and you who stand here and moralize
over me: I will crawl over your corpse at last.’”</p>

<p>The locations of ancient and of modern Jericho
are not exactly the same, though not far apart.
The present village is inhabited by about 600
Arabs who are huddled together in less than
seventy-five houses. Houses, did I say? They
are unworthy of the name. They are wretched
huts, constructed, for the most part, of rough, unhewn,
undressed stone. As these stones are put
together without the use of mortar, the walls are
broad at the bottom, and get narrower and a little
narrower towards the top, which is about six feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
from the ground. In each of the four corners of
this rock pen, is driven a stake which is usually
about eight feet high, or some two feet higher
than the top of the wall. Long, straight poles
reach from one stake to another, then other poles
are placed like lattice work all across the top of
the pen. A thick layer of grass and weeds and
cane tops having been placed on these cross poles,
dirt, or earth, is then piled up to a depth of from
eighteen to twenty-four inches. Thus the roof is
formed. The floor is more simple in its construction,
as it is composed of the native earth or
bare rock. Doors are simply gaps in the wall.
Windows and chimneys are unknown, and indeed
unnecessary&mdash;air-holes are abundant, and the
smoke can escape anywhere. The rude houses
are separated from each other, and the whole
village is surrounded, by a low, rough hedge of
dry, thorny bushes. This is a fair representation
of the present architecture of Jericho. And the
inhabitants are as lazy and trifling, as filthy and
ignorant, as the huts they live in would naturally
suggest. The children dress in sunshine, while
the parents hide their nakedness with rags and
loose wraps of cloth.</p>

<p>The Plain of Jericho, seven by ten miles in
extent, was at one time, according to Josephus, “a
divine region, covered with beautiful gardens, and
groves of palms of all kinds, the whole splendidly
watered.” The water supply, no doubt, came
then, as it comes now, from the Sultan’s Spring, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
as it is sometimes called, the Spring of Elisha.
This bold and beautiful fountain bursts forth
from the foot of the Judean hills some two miles
from Jericho, and, flowing across the plain in a
southwesterly direction, empties into the Jordan.
From the main channel, a large number of small
streams flow out in different directions into the
valley, and thus fructify a considerable portion
of the plain. The half cultivated patches we
find here now, though only partially irrigated,
are exceedingly rich and productive. The climate
in this valley is suitable to the growth of
almost any tropical or warm-natured plant. But
the meagre crops are confined to wheat, millet,
tobacco, cucumbers, and beans. On this plain,
near the Wady Kelt, through which we entered
the valley, is a large stone reservoir, 471
feet by 564 feet, called the Pool of Moses. Going
across the plain to this mammoth pool, is an
old aqueduct which evidently supplied it, at
one time, with water. Then smaller aqueducts
carried the water to all parts of the valley. This
pool, and these aqueducts, were probably built
by Mark Antony just before he gave this region
of country to Cleopatra, or by Herod the Great,
whose base life was ended at Jericho in a fit
of agony. By this means of irrigation the valley
became what it might be made again&mdash;“the
glory of the Jordan.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">THE Plain of Moab, east of the Jordan, is, in
character of soil and state of cultivation,
very much like the Jericho plain described
in the last chapter. The Plain of Moab is bounded
on the east, as before stated, by a wall of rock
which lifts itself up at some places almost perpendicularly,
several hundred feet above the valley.
From the top of this mountain ridge there stretches
far away toward the east, a broad, elevated
table-land, sloping gently as it recedes. This
table-land is traversed here and there by deep
wadys and narrow ravines, most of which have a
general westwardly, direction, and empty their
waters into the Jordan and Dead Sea. This
goodly land of Moab is about fifty miles long by
twenty broad, and this rolling plateau, though
3,200 feet above the sea level, is remarkably rich
and well watered. The country only needs a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
wise head and an energetic hand to make these
plains once more blossom as the rose.</p>

<p>In order to enter the promised land, it was
necessary for the Israelites to pass through this
delightful region of country. Accordingly Moses
“sent messengers unto Sihon, King of the Amorites,
saying, Let me pass through thy land: we
will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards;
we will not drink of the waters of the well: but
we will go along by the king’s highway, until we
be past thy borders.” A reasonable request this;
but instead of granting it, “Sihon gathered all his
people together” and went out to fight against
Israel; went out to meet Moses and&mdash;death!
Having routed the foe and possessed the land,
Israel marched into Heshbon, the imperial city.
Heshbon, now called Hasban, is situated among
the hills of Moab, a little to the north, and about
eight miles to the east, of the Dead Sea. The
ancient city, as the present ruins clearly show,
was situated on two high hills some distance
apart, east and west from each other, and on the
saddle connecting the two.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this fair land ought to be
gentlemen living like kings and princes. But instead
of that they are separate, independent, and
lawless clans or tribes of Arabs who live now, as
in ancient times, not altogether, but chiefly, on
plunder and the spoils of war. These clans east
of the Jordan are now, and have always been, a
curse to Palestine. Frequently at night they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
swoop down like eagles upon the inhabitants west
of the river, rob them of their grain, and drive
away their camels, their flocks and herds. This
practice frequently becomes so common that the
government is forced to protect the people by
keeping an armed body of soldiers along the river.</p>

<p>Lest the reader should think me unduly prejudiced
against these sons of the desert, I here
introduce a quotation from the “Desert of the
Exodus.” Be it remembered that this splendid
work was written by Prof. E. H. Palmer, a member
of the faculty of Cambridge University, England.
Perhaps no man has lived during the present
generation who knew more than he about Arab
life and character. The fact that Prof. Palmer
was afterwards brutally murdered by these people
shows that his estimate of their character was
correct and just. He says: “Robbery is not regarded
by the Bedawin as in the least a disgraceful
thing, but ‘a man taketh his sword, and goeth
his way to rob and steal’ (Esdras IV., 23), with a
profound feeling of conscious rectitude and respectability.
Several plans have been tried, from
time to time, to make him a respectable member
of society, but have signally failed; missionaries
have gone to him, and, so long as they could
supply him with tobacco and keep open tent for
all comers, have found him sufficiently tractable.
But they have made absolutely no impression
upon him, after all. Indeed, the state of desert
society has but little changed since the messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
came in to the tent of Job, and said: ‘The Chaldeans
made out three bands, and fell upon the
camels, and have carried them away, yea, and
slain the servants with the edge of the sword’”
(Job I., 17).</p>

<p>“Agriculture might be made a means of improving
the condition of the Arabs; indeed, the
only other method of attaining this end would be
to civilize them off the face of the earth altogether.
By Arab I mean the Bedawi, the typical
son of Ishmael, ‘whose hand is against every man,’
and who is as much hated and feared in the towns
and villages of Central Arabia as in Palestine.
Wherever he goes, he brings with him ruin, violence,
and neglect. To call him a ‘son of the
desert’ is a misnomer; half the desert owes its
existence to him, and many a fertile plain from
which he has driven its useful and industrious
inhabitants becomes in his hands, like the ‘South
Country,’ a parched and barren wilderness. He
has a constitutional dislike to work, and is entirely
unscrupulous as to the means he employs to
live without it; these qualities (which also adorn
and make the thief and burglar of civilization) he
mistakes for evidences of thorough breeding, and
prides himself accordingly upon being one of
Nature’s gentlemen.” (pp. 240, 241, 243).</p>

<p>There are so many dens and caves and strongholds
in the mountains of Moab that it would be
next to impossible for the government to rid
herself of these Arab clans. I am told that now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
and for many years past, the most powerful of all
these lawless tribes is the one called Beni Sukrh,
whose head quarters are the famous city and
fortress of Kerak. This stronghold is situated
on the banks and near the mouth of the river
Arnon, which empties into the Dead Sea on the
west side, and about fifteen miles from its north
end. This clan some years ago captured Canon
Tristram and party, and exacted from them a
large sum of money as a ransom. In his “Land
of Moab” Tristram has given a peculiarly striking
description of the fortress Kerak, in which he,
himself, was prisoner. It is built on an isolated
rock which rises high in the air, and whose level
summit is surrounded on all sides but the eastern
by chasms from 800 to 1,000 feet deep, and 100
feet wide, with perpendicular sides. A well-built
wall surrounds the brow of the precipice on all
sides, and the only two places of entrance are
through arches tunneled in the solid rock from
the side of the precipice to the level within.
These narrow and well-guarded entrances are approached
by rock-hewn paths, barely wide enough
for men or asses to walk on in single file. This
is one of the most impregnable strongholds on
earth. Gibraltar is not to be compared with it.
In this citadel one could safely say:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“I will not be afraid of death and bane<br />
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.”</p>

<p class="p1">This is the Kir-Hareseth of Scripture, and here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
it was that Mesha, King of Moab, took refuge
after his army was destroyed by the combined
forces of Israel, Judah, and Edom. These three
kings cut Mesha’s army to pieces, but they knew
it was folly to besiege his castle. Coming to this,
they gave up in despair and went home. After
their departure, Mesha, filled with gratitude for
the safety that this fortress afforded him, “took
his eldest son, that should have reigned in his
stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon
the wall.”</p>

<p>Probably it would be well in this connection to
mention a celebrated stone that I saw in a museum
in Paris. Do you ask, “Why introduce that
stone here?” Because this is the proper place to
introduce it. It is the famous Moabite Stone
that was found among the ruins of Dhiban not
many miles from this place. Dhiban (the Dibon
of Scripture), situated on two hills, is now only a
ruined village, although the numerous traces of
buildings existing in the community indicate that
it was once a flourishing town. In 1868 Rev. F.
A. Klein, a missionary of the English church,
while digging amid the rubbish of Dhiban, made
the fortunate discovery. This basaltic rock, two
by three feet in size, with one side covered by a
Moabite inscription, has a strange history and
tells a wonderful tale.</p>

<p>When the stone was discovered a great ado
was made over it. The Prussian government
sought and obtained permission to remove it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
The Bedouin tribe in whose territory it was found
was offered an enormous sum of money to part
with it. Indeed, the amount offered was so great
that the Arabs thought the stone must be of
untold value. The news spread. Another tribe
near by, hearing of the new-found stone and the
great price offered for it, marched over and claimed
it as their own. As about the “Slave Stone,”
a quarrel and a war ensued between the tribes,
during which many men were slaughtered on both
sides. The Stone was broken, but afterwards the
pieces were put together, and the inscription was
translated.</p>

<p>“The inscription,” says Prof. Palmer, “commemorates
the reign of a certain Mesha, King of Moab,
and records the triumphs obtained by him over
Israel in the course of a long and sanguinary
struggle. It begins by setting forth his name and
titles, and briefly recounts his successful effort to
throw off the yoke of the King of Israel; then
follows a list of bloody battles fought, of towns
wrested from the enemy, and of spoil and captives
fallen into his hands. For these conquests he
returns solemn thanks to Chemosh, his god&mdash;‘the
abomination of Moab’&mdash;and glories with a religious
fervor, that sounds strangely to our ears, in
having despoiled the sanctuary of Jehovah.”</p>

<p>The inscription concludes by setting forth the
names of towns rebuilt or fortified by the Moabite
king, of altars raised to Chemosh, of wells and
cisterns dug, and other peaceful work accomplished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
This portion of the record is a most valuable
addition to our knowledge of sacred geography;
for the names, as given on the Moabite Stone,
engraved by one who knew them in his daily life,
are, in nearly every case, absolutely identical with
those found in the Bible itself and testify to the
wonderful integrity with which the Scriptures have
been preserved. So far we have the history of
King Mesha’s rebellion from his own Moabite
point of view, and so far we read of nothing but
his success; but, if we turn to 2 Kings III: 5-27,
we may look upon the other side of the picture.
In that passage we have a concise but vivid account
of the rebellion and temporary successes
against Israel of this same monarch. There we
learn how the allied kings of Israel, Judah and
Edom, went against the rebellious prince; how
they marched by way of Edom, that is, round by
the southern end of the Dead Sea; how they
devastated the land of Moab, and drove their foeman
to take refuge in his fortress of Kir-Haraseth,
in Wady Kerak. The passage referred to above
speaks of the author of the Dhiban inscription in
the following terms:</p>

<p>“And Mesha, King of Moab, was a sheep-master,
and rendered unto the King of Israel an
hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thousand
rams with wool.” (2 Kings III: 4). Here,
again, the Bible receives fresh confirmation from
geographical facts; Moab, with its extensive grass-covered
uplands, is even now an essentially sheepbreeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
country, although the “fenced cities and
folds for sheep,” of which mention is made in the
Book of Numbers (XXXII: 36), are all in ruins.
But in its palmier days, when those rich pastures
were covered with flocks, no more appropriate
title could have been given to the king of such a
country than that he “was a sheep-master.”</p>

<p>In this same mountainous region, about six
miles north of Kerak, near the head of a deep
wady which empties into the Dead Sea, is situated
Machaerus, where the head-man’s ax ended the
earthly life of John the Baptist, the forerunner of
Christ. Machaerus, like Kerak, is a natural fortress&mdash;one
of Nature’s strongholds. Josephus
describes it as follows: “The nature of the place
was very capable of affording the surest hopes of
safety to those that possessed it, as well as delay
and fear to those that should attack it; for what
was walled in was itself a very rocky hill, elevated
to a very great height, which circumstance alone
made it very hard to be subdued. It was also so
contrived by nature that it could not be easily
ascended; for it is, as it were, ditched about with
such valleys on all sides, and to such a depth, that
the eye can not reach their bottoms, and such as
are not easily to be passed over, and even such
as it is impossible to fill up with earth. For that
valley which cuts it on the west extends to three
score furlongs; on the same side it was also that
Machaerus had the tallest top of its hill elevated
above the rest. But then for the valleys that lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
on the north and south sides, although they be
not so large as that already described, yet it is in
like manner an impracticable thing to think of
getting over them; and for the valley that lies on
the east side, its depth is found to be no less than
a hundred cubits. It extends as far as a mountain
that lies over against Machaerus, with which
it is bounded. Herod built a wall round on top
of the hill, and erected towers at the corners a
hundred and sixty cubits high; in the middle of
which place he built a palace, after a magnificent
manner, wherein were large and beautiful edifices.
He also made a great many reservoirs for the
reception of water, that there might be plenty of
it ready for all uses” (Wars VI: 1-2).</p>

<p>Inside of this impregnable fortress, the traveler
of to-day finds two prison chambers cut in the
solid rock. These rock-hewn dungeons once
echoed the tread, and resounded with the songs
and prayers, of that strong-charactered and iron-willed
man of God who came to prepare the way
of the Lord&mdash;to make His paths straight! It
makes one shudder to stand here amidst the
solemn grandeur of these storm-beaten rocks, and
contemplate the tragic history of this great man.
A great man? Yes. It was John the Baptist
who first had the courage to stand before his
fellow-countrymen, and, looking them squarely in
the face, say: “Repent ye; for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand.” With stentorian voice he
cried: “O, generation of vipers;” “the ax is laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
at the root of the tree;” “God is able of these
stones to raise up children unto Abraham.” “He
that cometh after me shall baptize you with fire,
He will thoroughly purge His floor and will burn
up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” It was John
the Baptist who buried Christ the Lord in yonder
rolling river. It was John the Baptist who pointed
to Him and said: “Behold, the Lamb of God
that taketh away the sin of the world.”</p>

<p>I thank God for the life and character of John
the Baptist who, after all the honors heaped upon
him, could say, I am nobody&mdash;I am simply the
<i>voice</i> of One crying in the wilderness. He that
cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I
am not worthy to bear. He must <i>increase</i> but I
must <i>decrease</i>. Yes, John said that he was nobody&mdash;that
he was only a <i>voice</i>, and yet Jesus
says: “Among those born of women there hath
not arisen a greater than John the Baptist.” Oh,
to be <i>nobody</i>! Oh, to be only the <i>voice of Jesus</i>,
calling men unto righteousness, and warning them
to flee the wrath to come! Oh, that the writer
and the reader of this chapter may “rise upon the
stepping-stones of their dead selves to higher
things!” O, God, graciously grant, I pray thee,
that both writer and reader may realize that the
<i>magnitude of any life is to be determined by the
distance of self from the centre</i>!</p>

<p>In the same chasm with Machaerus, and not far
away, there is a group of ten hot springs bursting
forth from the side of the wady one hundred feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
or more from its rocky bed. Although in close
proximity to each other these springs vary in
temperature from 130 to 142 degrees. According
to Josephus, some of these fountains are bitter
and others sweet. The waters are said to possess
great medicinal properties and healing virtues.
The maimed, the halt, and the blind resort hither
in search of health. While living at Jericho, just
before his death, Herod the Great, according to
Josephus, came to these springs hoping to drown
his disease. But the wicked, adulterous, murderous
Herod was not so sick, I trow,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“As he was troubled with thick-coming fancies<br />
That kept him from his rest.”</p>

<p class="p1">Herod was a murderer; and wash his guilt away
he never could. He might wash, and wash and
wash, and cry: “Out, out damned spot!” But
there was the “smell of blood still.” He might
have said as Macbeth afterwards did:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood<br />
Clean from my hand? No; this my hand will rather<br />
The multitudinous seas incarnadine,<br />
Making the green one red.”</p>

<p class="p1">North of Machaerus, and not far from Heshbon,
is Mt. Nebo from which Moses viewed the land of
promise, and upon which, also, he breathed his
last. This peak, as one would naturally suppose,
commands a fine view of the surrounding country.
For twenty miles to the south and southeast, one’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
eyes sweep over an elevated table-land of unusual
richness and beauty. The range of vision toward
the rising sun extends to where the blue sky and
the sandy desert meet. Looking westward one
sees the valley of the Jordan, and traces the
wanderings of the river from the Sea of Galilee
to the Dead Sea. Beyond the Jordan is the land
of “milk and honey” that Moses was never allowed
to enter. Moses came up hither from the
plain of Moab, and the Lord showed him the
country and said unto him, “This is the land
which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and
unto Jacob saying, I will give it unto thy seed:
I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but
thou shalt not go over thither. So Moses the
servant of the Lord died there in the land of
Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And
he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab,
over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of
his sepulchre unto this day. And Moses was an
hundred and twenty years old when he died: his
eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.”</p>

<p>As the reader sits in his swinging hammock
beneath the wide-spreading branches of some
great oak and pronounces these words to a listening
friend, they may sound light and trifling. But
if he could stand here where I am, and lift his
eyes from the sacred page and let them fall at
once upon the surrounding hills and valleys, methinks
these words would then each <i>weigh a pound</i>.
I have never studied the life of any mortal man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
with the same degree of interest that I now study
the life and character of Moses. Probably it is
all the more enjoyable because I have been down
in Egypt where Moses was born. I have been
sailing up and down the Nile where Moses once
floated in the ark of bulrushes. As I sat in a
boat on the broad bosom of that majestic river,
and looked out upon its banks, I half-way imagined
that I could see Moses’s mother weaving the
ark. Reader, would you know how that ark was
made? Well, it was on this wise. Moses’s mother
took a bulrush, and a prayer, and faith, and a tear,
and plaited them together. Then more faith, and
tears, and bulrushes, and prayers, and plaited
them together. When a mother has thus woven
an ark, she can trustingly launch her babe upon
any waters! And I am persuaded that if we, in
our Christian work, would use more faith and
tears and prayers and less bulrushes, it would be
far better for our Redeemer’s Kingdom.</p>

<p>I repeat that I have been in Egypt where
Moses was born; on the Nile where he floated;
to Pharaoh’s court where he was educated; I
have been out on the desert where Moses killed
an Egyptian because he imposed upon a Hebrew.
I then climbed to the top of the regal pyramid,
and looked out over the land of Goshen where
Israel served four hundred years in bondage. I
followed Moses down to the Red Sea where he
led Israel across. I looked up to the frowning
brow of Sinai where Moses met God face to face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and talked with him as man to man; where he
reached up and received from the hand of God
the tables of stone on which were written the
Ten Commandments.</p>

<p>After following Moses around in the wilderness
to some extent, I have come now to where his
eyes were closed in death. The inhabitants of
this country have no written history, but they
know a great deal traditionally about the life and
character of Moses. Many weird stories and
beautiful legends concerning him have been handed
down from generation to generation, and are
as fresh in the minds of the people to-day as if he
had died within the recollection of some now living.
Frequently in these stories Scripture history
and legendary lore are beautifully interwoven.
For instance, the people here say that Moses with
three million Jews had camped on the plain of
Moab. And God said unto him, “Moses, get thee
up into yonder mountain, and I will show thee
from thence the land of promise.” When God
spake Moses obeyed&mdash;he started at once. Standing
high upon the mountain side he looked back
upon the tabernacle and the tents of Israel. The
people followed him with their prayers and blessings.
He paused, looked back at his brethren,
and waved them a last adieu, as if to say,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Fare thee well, and if forever,<br />
Still forever fare thee well.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then with his face turned toward the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
top, and his heart lifted to heaven, he continued
his onward, upward journey, climbing higher and
higher, until after a while there was nothing at all
above him save eagles, and stars, and God. Away
up here above the earth Moses saw two men&mdash;two
angels in the form of men, and said unto
them, “Brethren, what are you doing?” “We are
digging a grave, sir.” “For whom are you digging
the grave?” “We know not for whom it is. God
told us to dig it, and we are simply doing His
bidding. And, Moses,” they continue, “the man
for whom we are digging this grave is the best
creature in all the earth&mdash;God loves him well.
He is just about your size, and, Moses, we do not
know whether this grave is long enough and deep
enough. Will you please lie down here and
measure it for us?” Moses responded, “Yea,
brethren, if you request it.” “We do request it.”
So Moses lay down to measure the grave for
them, and they stooped over and kissed him to
sleep, and Moses was dead.</p>

<p>These people have other legends about Moses
as pathetic and beautiful as the one just given.
But we have seen enough to know that</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“By Nebo’s lonely mountain,</p>

<p class="pp6">In a vale in the land of Moab,</p>

<p class="drop-capi08">I AM now, as never before, impressed with this
thought; that God’s plans and purposes never
depend upon any one man. When Moses
was no more, Joshua took up, and carried on to
completion, his unfinished work. We also have
here a beautiful example of how the labors of
God’s servants are interlinked with each other.
Moses liberated Israel from Egyptian bondage,
but it was left for Joshua to lead them into the
promised land. Forty years they had wandered
in the wilderness, warring with the different tribes
through whose territory they had passed; forty
years they had been miraculously fed with manna;
forty years they were guided by a pillar of cloud
by day, and a pillar of fire by night,&mdash;but at last
the gladsome day came when they were to exchange
the stony wilderness for the land that
flowed with milk and honey. There was joy in
the camp. With happy hearts and strong hands,
three million Hebrews folded their tents and
marched side by side, shoulder to shoulder, to the
river’s brink. And I am sure that while there
they sang in spirit, if not in letter:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“On Jordan’s stormy banks we stand,</p>
<p class="pp7">And cast a wishful eye</p>
<p class="pp6">To Canaan’s fair and happy land,</p>

<p>It is well to walk in the footsteps of great men;
so having followed Moses out of Egypt, let us
now follow Joshua into Canaan. Leaving Nebo’s
summit, and coming down on the north side of
the mountain, we find at its base a bold spring
which bears the name of the great law-giver.
Around this spring of Moses the hosts of Israel,
it is supposed, pitched their tents. Still following
Joshua, we soon find ourselves standing on the
banks of the Jordan. Ah, sacred river! How it
thrills me to be here! “Thy banks, winding in a
thousand graceful mazes, are fringed with perpetual
verdure; thy pathway is cheered with the
sight and song of birds, and by thy own clear
voice of gushing minstrelsy. There is a pleasure
in the green-wooded banks, seen far along the
sloping valley; a tracery of life, amid the death
and dust that hem thee in, so like some trace of
gentleness in a corrupt and wicked heart.”</p>

<p>I have crossed many important streams. I
have been on the Rio Grande; I have sailed up
and down the Mississippi and the Ohio, the Hudson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
and the St. Lawrence; I have sailed on
the Thames through London; on the Seine
through Paris; on the Tiber through Rome; on
the Rhine through Germany; on the Danube
through all western Europe; and the Nile through
Egypt,&mdash;and yet I freely acknowledge that I was
never so moved by any stream as by the sight of
this historic river. It was the Jordan that divided
and let the children of Israel pass over on dry
ground. It was the Jordan whose waters cleansed
Naaman of his leprosy. It was the Jordan whose
stream floated an ax at the prophet’s command.
It was the Jordan, also, on whose banks another
prophet stood and preached repentance, and in
whose waters he buried Christ in baptism. John
the Baptist was a man after my own heart. He
came on the stage of action filled and fired with a
purpose. He was conscious of a commission from
God. He believed, therefore he spoke; and, as
he spoke, the people left their homes and hovels
in Jerusalem, Judea, and all the region round
about Jordan, and flocked to hear him.</p>

<p>Reader, we are on historic ground. Stand here
with me on the banks of the stream, and let us
behold a sacred scene together. The river here
makes a graceful curve towards the east, and is at
this point about fifty yards or one hundred and
fifty feet wide. The western bank, on which we
stand, is low and level, not more than eighteen
inches or two feet above the surface of the river,
and gently slopes down to the water. The opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
bank is a wall of rock, rising up perpendicularly
for eighteen or twenty feet, then receding
beautifully in a terrace, another terrace, and another
one still. Terraces rise above and beyond
each other like seats in an opera-house. These
terraces gracefully stretch themselves along the
rocky bluff of this river for two hundred yards or
more, until at least a hundred and fifty or two
hundred thousand people could be so seated along
the terraced bluff as to look down upon its watery
surface. Let us in our imagination re-people all
these terraces with the Jews of old, with their
quaint, Eastern costumes, with their hard faces
and beaming eyes. There they sit, rising tier
above tier.</p>

<p>Now on this low bank, not far from us, stands
the preacher in the midst of a great concourse of
people. Every ear is all attention, every eye is
on the preacher. See! his bosom heaves, his
face glows, his eyes sparkle, his words burn. His
sentences strike, swift and glittering, like lightning
flashes midst the roll of judgment-day thunders.
Terrors of the day of wrath roll over his hearers
as the foremost thought; sounds of hope break in,
like soft music, to keep the contrite from despair.
The moral world seems to shake. The people
realize as never before their sin, their guilt, their
need of a Savior. In their hearts they want, they
yearn for, the promised Messiah.</p>

<p>Now, lifting his eyes above the motley multitude,
John beholds a strange personage coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
towards him. Rough and rugged, bold and heroic,
John is not a man to shrink from his fellows. He
is no reed to be shaken by the wind. But, see!
he trembles as the stranger approaches. Spiritual
greatness wears a kingly crown which compels
instant reverence. John, a moment ago as bold
as a lion, is now as meek as a lamb. Shrinking
from the new-comer he says, “I have need to be
baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?” Jesus,
answering, said unto him, “Suffer it to be so now,
for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.”</p>

<p>Then leading Jesus down into the river he
baptizes Him; and immediately the heavens are
opened, the Spirit of God, like a dove, descends
and lights upon Him. There is the Son with the
Spirit resting upon His head, and, lo! a voice
from heaven, saying, “This is my beloved Son in
whom I am well pleased.” The vast multitude
who witness this strange sight are deeply moved.
They are profoundly impressed. What means
this strange baptism, this descent of the Spirit,
this voice of God? What means it all? Who is
this new-comer? John answers by pointing to
Jesus and saying, “Behold the Lamb of God that
taketh away the sin of the world.” As if to say,
“This is He of whom Moses and the prophets did
write&mdash;of whom I have told you, and before whom
every earthly monarch shall bow.” This day
have the people witnessed one of the most wonderful
events in the history of the world&mdash;a direct
manifestation of the Triune God. There has this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
day begun an agitation and stir among the people
that shall end in a tragedy on Calvary.</p>

<p>These scenes have made the Jordan a sacred
river. From the days of Constantine, to bathe or
to be baptized in this river has been regarded a
great privilege. We are told that “in the sixth
century, marble steps led down into the water on
both sides, at the spot where it is believed our
Lord was baptized, while a wooden cross rose in
the middle of the stream.” Nor has reverence
for this river diminished. On the contrary, it
seems to have increased. Each year, during the
week preceding Easter Sunday, thousands and
thousands of people, from all parts of the world,
assemble in Jerusalem and pitch their tents on
the surrounding hills. They continue to come
until the hills round about Jerusalem look like
one far-reaching city of many-colored tents.</p>

<p>Easter Sunday, with its strange ceremonies and
joyous songs, is over. Monday morning, bright
and early, there is great bustle and confusion in
the camp. Every tent is folded. Camels, mules,
and donkeys are packed ready for travel. The
people mount&mdash;sometimes whole families of five
or six on one camel. Some of the number stride
the animal, while others are suspended in baskets
which are tied together and hang on either side.
Leaving Jerusalem, the pilgrims, in one great
caravan, under the protection of the Turkish government,
start out for the “Sacred River.” The
Kedron valley and the side of the Mount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Olives are filled with inhabitants of Jerusalem
and the surrounding villages, who have come out
to see the annual procession pass. On they go,
an escort of Turkish soldiers with a white flag
and sweet music leading the way. Then come
camels and asses laden with pilgrims of every age
and condition, of every clime and country, clad in
costumes of every variety of cut and color, while
a second group of soldiers, with the green standard
of the prophet, closes the long procession.</p>

<p>As the shadows of evening begin to fall, the
pilgrims pitch their tents by Elisha’s Fountain in
the plain of Jericho. At night the whole plain is
dotted with cheerful camp-fires. Gathering here,
in groups of two or three hundred, the people
engage with great enthusiasm in a weird kind of
ceremony which is to prepare them for the next
day. At a late hour they fall asleep.</p>

<p>The scene that follows their waking is vividly
described by Lieut. Lynch of the U. S. Navy.
He says: “At 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, we were aroused by the intelligence
that the pilgrims were coming. Rising
in haste, we beheld thousands of torchlights, with
a dark mass beneath, moving rapidly over the
hills. Striking our tents with precipation, we
hurriedly removed them and all our effects a
short distance to the left. We had scarce finished,
when they were upon us:&mdash;men, women, and
children, mounted on camels, horses, mules, and
donkeys, rushed impetuously by toward the bank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
They presented the appearance of fugitives from
a routed army.</p>

<p>“Our Bedawin friends here stood us in good
stead;&mdash;sticking their tufted spears before our
tents, they mounted their steeds and formed a
military cordon around us. But for them we
should have been run down, and most of our
effects trampled upon, scattered and lost. In all
the wild haste of a disorderly rout, Copts and
Russians, Poles, Armenians, Greeks and Syrians,
from all parts of Asia, from Europe, from Africa,
and from far-distant America, on they came; men,
women and children, of every age and hue, and
in every variety of costume; talking, screaming,
shouting, in almost every known language under
the sun.</p>

<p>“Mounted as variously as those who had preceded
them, many of the women and children
were suspended in baskets or confined in cages;
and, with their eyes strained toward the river,
heedless of all intervening obstacles, they hurried
eagerly forward, and dismounting in haste and
disrobing with precipitation, rushed down the
bank and threw themselves into the stream. Each
one plunged himself, or was dipped by another,
three times, below the surface, in honor of the
Trinity; and then filled a bottle, or some other
utensil, from the river. The bathing-dress of
many of the pilgrims was a white gown with a
black cross upon it.</p>

<p>“In an hour they began to disappear; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
less time than three hours the trodden surface
of the lately crowded bank reflected no human
shadow. The pageant disappeared as rapidly as
it had approached, and left to us once more the
silence and the solitude of the wilderness. It was
like a dream. An immense crowd of human beings,
said to be 8,000, but I thought not so many,
had passed and re-passed before our tents, and
left not a vestige behind them.”</p>

<p>These pilgrims come in such haste and confusion
that frequently some of their number are
drowned. And yet so great is the fanatical enthusiasm
of the crowd that little or no concern is
awakened by the ill-timed death of the unfortunates.
The usual bathing-dress is a long, loose-flowing,
white gown. After bathing, the pilgrims
carefully fold up these robes, thus consecrated,
and carry them home with them to far-distant
lands, in different parts of the world, and use
them as burial-shrouds.</p>

<p>I have never seen a better place for bathing
and swimming. From the west side one wades
down into the river, getting deeper and deeper
the farther he goes from the bank. When about
half way across, the water becomes too deep for
wading, and close to the eastern bank it is so
deep that one can hardly dive to the bottom.
One finds water any depth from two to twelve
feet. The bottom, being composed of sand and
smooth rock, is all that could be desired. We are
so delighted to be here that we hardly know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
to leave. We remain, day after day, reading,
fishing, swimming. We catch several messes of
sweet, fresh fish, and fry and eat them on the
banks of the stream.</p>

<p>Having spoken somewhat at length about that
place in the Jordan where it is supposed, with
reasonable certainty, the Savior was baptized, and
which is also the bathing-place of the pilgrims, I
now proceed to describe the river from one end
to the other. But, before speaking of the river
proper, I desire to say something concerning the
Ghor, or <i>valley</i>, of the Jordan.</p>

<p>Beginning at the upper end of the Dead Sea,
the Jordan valley extends one hundred and ten
miles directly northward. It varies from three to
ten miles in width, and has an average width of
six miles. Now this valley, one hundred and ten
miles long and six miles wide, is shut in on the
east and west by great walls of rock. The eastern
bluff is bolder than the one on the west&mdash;that is,
it is more nearly perpendicular. It is also more
regular as to altitude, the height ranging probably
from 1,800 to 2,000 feet. The western wall,
though less regular than the other, is sometimes
as precipitous, and has some peaks that are as
high, if not higher.</p>

<p>The entire valley is very deep, its northern end
being 700 feet lower than the Mediterranean,
while its southern end is 600 feet lower still.
The whole valley is therefore one vast inclined
plane, sloping from north to south. Through this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
valley, somewhat nearer to the eastern than to
the western side, the Jordan winds its serpentine
path.</p>

<p>The river has its source in three bold springs
near the upper end of the valley. One of these
springs bursts forth from the side of Mt. Hermon,
2,200 feet <i>above</i> the Mediterranean. A second
strong spring gushes out from under a bold rock-cliff
at Caesarea Philippi. These two springs are
on the eastern side of the valley, while the third,
which is of itself a small river, issues from the
foot of the western hills, near the city of Dan.
All of these fountains are large and beautiful.
All of them send forth copious streams of fresh
and sparkling water. Any one of them could run
a half dozen mills, or factories, or irrigate the
whole valley. These crystal waters, after flowing
gently, and sometimes rushing madly, along their
separate courses, unite for the first time in the
little Lake of Huleh, or the waters of Merom, as
it is often called.</p>

<p>Huleh, about two by four miles square, is in the
southern end of an exceedingly rich and fertile
plain. In this plain, and around these waters,
Joshua had some of his hardest-fought battles.
Leaving this lake, the waters flow rapidly through
a narrow, rocky gorge for eleven miles, and then
empty into the Sea of Galilee, which is, in round
numbers, 700 feet <i>lower</i> than the surface of the
Mediterranean. Remember, one spring came out
from Hermon’s side 2,200 feet above the Mediterranean.
In the short distance of thirty-six miles,
therefore, the waters have fallen 2,900 feet!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jordan proper is the stream connecting
the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea. These
seas are only sixty-five miles apart; but the river,
as if reluctant to enter that bitter Sea of Death,
winds and twists so like a serpent that the water,
in going from one sea to the other, flows two
hundred miles, and empties at last into the Dead
Sea, 1,300 feet below the Mediterranean!</p>

<p>The Jordan has three sets of banks, which are
marked with more or less distinctness according
as the hills approach near to, or recede from, the
river. Ordinarily, of course, the stream is confined
within the lower banks. But during the annual
rise the water over-flows these lower banks, and
spreads out over the valley between the second
terraces, or banks. No important tributaries are
received from the west; but the Hieromax and
the Jabbok, each a small river, empty into the
Jordan from the east. The river is crossed by
four well-known fords; one just below the Sea of
Galilee, another just above the mouth of the
Jabbok. The third and fourth are respectively
above and below the pilgrim’s bathing-place, which
is about two and a half miles north of the Dead
Sea. No bridge spans the river at present, but
the remains of old Roman bridges may still be
seen at some of the fords.</p>

<p>In some places, the channel of the river is shut
in by rock banks, steep and precipitous. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
others, the banks are of sand, or rich earth, and
rise only a few feet above the surface of the
water. Sometimes one bank is a bold rock cliff,
rising abruptly, while the other slopes gently up
from the river, and stretches out to join the
fertile plain.</p>

<p>Since the Jordan has its source in a fountain
bursting out of a mountain side 2,200 feet above
the Mediterranean, and since it empties into the
Dead Sea 1,300 feet below the Mediterranean, a
great many people falsely conclude that the river
must, of necessity, be very swift. I grant that this
seems a strong argument. Think of a river 136
miles long having a fall of 3,500 feet! The natural
supposition is that such a stream would be
exceedingly swift. But not so. The facts will
not bear out the supposition. To be swift, a
stream must have not only a great fall, but it
must have, also, a comparatively straight channel.
The Jordan is probably the most crooked river
on earth. In a space of sixty-five miles of latitude,
and five or six miles of longitude, it traverses
at least two hundred miles. In some places,
to be sure, the current is swift, as there are thirty
or more falls, or rapids, in the Jordan. Some of
these are quite marked, while others are less so.
While near these falls, the stream is swift. In
other places the water is deep, and moves sluggishly.</p>

<p>In speaking of the velocity of the water, it
might be well to mention that a few years ago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Lieut. Lynch, under appointment of the United
States government, navigated the river from one
end to the other. He met with many difficulties
and some dangers. Shooting the rapids was perilous
work. One of his boats was dashed against
the rocks and went to pieces. Lieut. Lynch’s
official report to the United States Navy department
is the fullest, most accurate, and reliable
description of the Jordan that has ever been published
in this country.</p>

<p>Again. Inasmuch as the Jordan rises in the
mountains, and is constantly fed by the melting
snows of Hermon, some philosophical students
have argued that the water must necessarily be
very cold at all times. But a few facts are worth
a cartload of theories. And, as a matter of fact,
the water of the Jordan is not cold, except during
the winter season; and even then the temperature
is by no means low. I bathed in the Jordan repeatedly;
once as late as the Fifteenth of December,
and the water was even then of a delightful
temperature for bathing.</p>

<p>The river valley is so deeply depressed that
scarcely a breath of air is felt during the hot
season. On this point, Dr. Geikie says: “The
heat of the Jordan plains is very great in summer,
and oppressive even in spring; while in autumn it
becomes very unhealthy for strangers. In May,
the thermometer ranges from about 86 degrees in
the early forenoon to over 100 degrees in the
beginning of the afternoon, standing, even in the
shade, at over 90 degrees.” The annual mean
temperature of the lower Jordan valley is between
70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. From the above
facts, the reader will readily see that it is quite
impossible for a stream flowing through this valley
ever to reach a very low temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>The stream is from seventy-five to three hundred
feet wide, and probably has an average
depth of six and a half feet, or more, even during
the dry season. At some places, however, the
depth is much greater than this. Here and there,
islands, robed in garments of living green, and
decked with flowers of every hue, float, fairy-like,
upon the bosom of the river.</p>

<p>The terraces along the river are frequently one
mass of vegetation. The weeping-willow grows
on the banks, and dips her flowing tresses in the
sacred stream. As one follows the windings of
the historic river, his way is continually cheered
by the gushing sound of some crystal rivulet, by
the beauty and fragrance of the flowers, by the
sight and song of birds. The tangled vine, the
matted cane, the thick-growing forest trees of
considerable size, and a great variety of undergrowth,
form a general rendezvous for wild animals,
and a perfect paradise for birds. Hyenas,
tigers, wild boars, and bears abound here, especially
on the eastern side of the river. Here hawks,
herons, pigeons, ducks, doves, and swallows build
their nest and raise their young. Here also the bulbul
and the nightingale sing their songs of praise.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi12">THE Dead Sea is, in many respects, the most
wonderful body of water known to history.
It is the lowest body of water on earth.
Its surface is 1,300 feet lower than the surface of
the Mediterranean, though the two seas are only
sixty-five miles apart. It receives 6,000,000 tons,
or 20,000,000 cubic feet, of water each day; and,
while it has no possible outlet, it never fills up.
It is no fuller now than it was a thousand years
ago. This Sea of Death is wonderful for another
reason. While it is forty-six miles long, thirteen
miles wide, and while the water is 1,310 feet deep,
I can walk across it and never get wet above my
waist! I walk out into the sea for a mile or
more&mdash;I walk not on the water, but in it. I fold
my hands across my breast, stretch them out over
the water, or lock them over my head, as I choose.
I try to sink and can not. I never felt so much
like a gourd in all my life. I sit down upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
water like a feather-bed. When tired I lie down.
Some men lie when they stand up; but when I
lie I am prostrated. I lie on the water, roll over,
kick my feet in the air,&mdash;but all my attempts at
sinking meet with an inglorious failure. Johnson
says a man who will not sink in clear water must
be of little weight in the world. Determined to
make one more effort, I climb to a projecting rock
from which I plunge head foremost into the sea.
A moment later I am tossed into the air like a
cork. Again I strike the water, and again rebound.
I am, seemingly, about as heavy on the
stomach of the Dead Sea as Jonah was on the
stomach of a live whale. He was spewed up&mdash;so
am I.</p>

<p>Coming up out of the water I find myself completely
covered with a thin crust of salt. I hardly
know who I am. Johnson suggests that I may
be Lot’s wife. One thing is sure; I have a better
complexion&mdash;at any rate I am whiter now than
ever before. Johnson asks why it is that one can
not sink in the Dead Sea. The specific gravity
of the water is very great. This, of course, makes
the water very buoyant, and renders it impossible
for one to sink. The extra weight of the water is
caused by the great amount of salt in the sea. It
is a much easier matter to swim in the ocean than
in a running stream, because the former is salt
and, therefore, buoyant. This is true, notwithstanding
the fact that only four per cent of ocean
water is salt. Four per cent is enough to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
the ocean very salt and buoyant. But of the
Dead Sea water twenty-six to twenty-eight per
cent is salt. It has, therefore, six or six and a
half times as much salt as the same amount of
ocean water has. Then how great its specific
gravity! How buoyant its waters! How impossible
to sink!</p>

<p>This is sometimes called the “Salt Sea,” and,
while the name is quite brackish, it is not at all
inappropriate; for, as has been said, “the water
is a nauseous compound of bitters and Salts.”
When I stiffen myself and stretch out on the
waters, about half of my person remains above
the surface. The water produces something of a
stinging sensation; not severe enough, however,
to be especially objectionable, unless you should
chance to get some of it in your eyes. The
buoyancy of the water makes its navigation both
difficult and dangerous. Lieut. Lynch, in the
following lines, gives us a vivid description of his
experiences on this Sea of Death.</p>

<p>“A fresh northwest wind was blowing as we
rounded the point. We endeavored to steer a
little to the north of west, to make a true west
course, and threw the patent log overboard to
measure the distance; but the wind rose so rapidly
that the boats could not keep head to wind,
and we were obliged to haul the log in. The sea
continued to rise with the increasing wind, which
gradually freshened to a gale, and presented an
agitated surface of foaming brine; the spray, evaporating
as it fell, left incrustations of salt upon
our clothes, our hands and faces; and while it
conveyed a prickly sensation wherever it touched
the skin, was, above all, exceedingly painful to the
eyes. The boats, heavily laden, struggled sluggishly
at first; but when the wind freshened in its
fierceness, from the density of the water, it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
as if their bows were encountering the sledgehammers
of the Titans, instead of the opposing
waves of an angry sea. The wind blew so fiercely
that the boats could make no headway, and I
began to fear that both boats would founder.
Finding that we were losing every moment, and
that, with the lapse of each succeeding one, the
danger increased, kept away for the northern
shore, in the hope of being yet able to reach it;
our arms, our clothes and skins coated with a
greasy salt; and our eyes, lips, and nostrils, smarting
excessively. How different was the scene
before the submerging of the plain, which was
‘even as the garden of the Lord!’</p>

<p>“But, although the sea had assumed a threatening
aspect, and the fretted mountains, sharp and
incinerated, loomed terrific on either side, and
salt and ashes mingled with its sands, and foetid
sulphurous springs trickled down its ravines, we
did not despair: awe-struck, but not terrified;
fearing the worst, yet hoping for the best, we prepared
to spend a dreary night upon the dreariest
waste we had ever seen.”</p>

<p>The foreign substance in the water gives it a
peculiar appearance at night. Under the influence
of a full moon, the sea has a strikingly bright
and beautiful phosphorescent glow. The breakers
dashing against the rocks, and beating against
the shore, look like waves of consuming fire. The
whole scene resembles a restless, turbulent sea of
flame vainly trying to devour the very rocks that
mark its limits! Going around the sea next
morning, the rock-bound coast, and the bleak
desolate hills around, look as though they might
have been scorched with fire the night before.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">LOT’S WIFE.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>In seeking for a satisfactory explanation of
why this water is so salt, Johnson argues thus;
“Sodom and Gomorrah once stood at the north
end of this sea. From here Lot fled with his
family when the cities were destroyed. On one
of the surrounding hills Lot’s wife was standing,
when she disobediently looked back and was immediately
turned into a pillar of salt.” Johnson
becomes more and more animated as he contemplates
the subject and expresses his views. His
face is radiant with gladness, and his soul is all
aglow with emotion, as he closes with this sentence:
“Now, Whittle, since Mrs. Lot was turned
to a pillar of salt upon one of these hills, we may
safely account for the present salty condition of
the water simply by supposing that she has melted
and run back into the sea.” This thought was
born in Johnson’s brain, and he nurses it with all
the love and passionate fondness that characterize
the young mother as she tenderly caresses her
new-born babe.</p>

<p>It is therefore with sincere regret that I raise
the golden hammer of truth to break the young
child’s head, but the false theory must die. I say,
“Johnson, come with me.” Going around on the
east side, not far from the north end, of the Dead
Sea, we come to a broad shelf of rock, probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
1,000 feet above the water. Arriving at the edge
of this stone table, and pointing to a colossal
statue of salt-rock standing on its centre, I say,
“Johnson, your theory is not true. Mrs. Lot has
not melted; for, behold, she still stands!” This
famous pillar is a slender, isolated needle of salt-rock,
thirty or thirty-five feet high. This, we are
told, is <i>actually Lot’s wife</i>. And I readily see
how a man with a diseased imagination could
fancy this a woman; for, as Professor Palmer
remarks, “It does really bear a curious resemblance
to an Arab woman with a child upon her
shoulders.” The rock lifts itself up solitary and
alone, something like a giantess, wearing tattered
garments and disheveled hair, while her furrowed
face is slightly turned over her left shoulder, as
though she were still looking back on the desolate
plain where the ill-fated cities once stood.</p>

<p>The Arabs point to this pillar as Lot’s wife.
M. de Saulcy has written very ingeniously to
prove that it really and truly is Lot’s wife. And,
to do the Frenchman justice, I should add that
he really did prove it&mdash;to his own satisfaction.
I dare say, however, that he utterly failed to convince
any of his readers. There have been men
in all the ages who found in this pillar, or some
other one like it, the veritable Mrs. Lot. Josephus
relates the Scriptural incident of Lot’s wife being
turned into salt, and then says of the pillar of salt:
“I have seen it, and it remains to this day.”
Clement of Rome, Irenaeus, and Leland all speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
of Lot’s wife still standing as a pillar of salt.
One says she still “retains her members entire,”
and another says that as fast as any part of this
pillar is washed away, it is supernaturally restored.
That Lot’s wife disobeyed God, and was forthwith
turned into a pillar of salt, I do not doubt.
That this pillar of salt will ever be located and
identified, I have no hope.</p>

<p>Let us again recur to the question, “Why is
this sea so salt?” Around the east side and
southern end of the sea, the whole country seems
to be composed largely of salt. “The salt hills
run round for several miles nearly east and west,
at a height of from three hundred to four hundred
feet, level atop, and not very broad; the mass
being a body of rock-salt, capped with a bed of
gypsum and chalk. Dislocated, shattered, furrowed
into deep clefts by the rains, or standing out
in narrow, ragged buttresses, they add to the
weird associations of all around. Here and there,
harder portions of the salt, withstanding the
weather while all around them melts and wears
off, rise up as isolated pillars. In front of the
ridge, the ground is strewn with lumps and masses
of salt, through which streamlets of brine run
across the long muddy flat towards the beach,
which itself sparkles in the sun with a crust of
salt, shining as if the earth had been sown with
diamonds.”</p>

<p>A sea whose bed and beach are salt would
naturally be brackish, even if it had an outlet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
During the rainy season this sea has probably a
thousand tributaries, all of which bring in more
or less salt. It is always receiving salt. Bear in
mind the fact that this Sea of Death has no outlet.
All of the water is taken up by evaporation.
In midsummer the heat around it is fearful to
contemplate. The rays from the noon-day’s sun
are almost like streams of fire. The heat is
simply intense. The water vaporizes, is taken up
into the air, and is there condensed and poured
out in showers of rain on the parched hills
around, to revive the vigor of vegetation. As
Thompson would say, “The clouds pour their
garnered fullness down.” Of course the sun takes
up only the oxygen and hydrogen, leaving all salt
and other impurities behind. Hence the sea never
fills up; hence also the water that is left behind
is becoming more and more salt as the years
pass by.</p>

<p>Just a word about the origin of the Dead Sea.
It is currently believed, and I think with good
reason, that at one time there was an unbroken
body of water, not very deep, extending from the
southern end of the Dead Sea, up through what is
now known as the Ghor or valley of the Jordan,
to the base of Mount Hermon, a distance of some
two hundred miles. The volcanic fires, which
were then raging, and the effects of which are still
to be seen, consumed the material underlying the
southern end of what was then the vast sea. All
at once, during the fierce rumblings of an earthquake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
and the sudden outburst of a volcano,
there was a tremendous cleaving and lowering of
the crust of the earth. Thus was formed, it is
supposed, the great rock-hewn basin, or deep depression,
which we now call the Dead Sea, and
whose bottom is 4,000 feet lower than the surface
of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>This great natural cavity, forty-six miles long,
and thirteen miles wide, was so very deep, and
had such an enormous capacity, that it drank up
or drained off most of the water that formerly extended
to the foot of Hermon. So instead of
one vast sea, two hundred miles in length, as it
then was, we now have Lake Huleh, the Sea of
Galilee and the Dead Sea, lying in a straight line,
directly north and south, the three joined to each
other by the river Jordan. There are many
evidences to show that the Jordan valley was
once covered with water&mdash;that it was once the
bed of a great sea.</p>

<p>Yes, the Dead Sea was evidently caused by
some fearful convulsion of nature. It is, indeed,
a bitter Sea of Death. It is a perpetual emblem
of God’s avenging wrath! No living thing inhabits
these waters. Not a tree, not a shrub, not
even a blade of grass, grows on, or near, the beach.
Here and there crystal rivulets attempt to bring
life down to the water’s edge, but a few hundred
yards from the sea Death meets Vegetation and
says: “Hitherto shalt thou come, and no farther.”
The thing that grows nearest to the water’s edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
is what is known as the Sodom apple, or Dead
Sea apple. The bush is about as high as my
head, the apples grow in clusters. When ripe,
they are red, and about the size of an apricot or
a peach. The apple has nothing in it but seed
and air. It pops when crushed. Hence the old
saying that it turns to ashes on the lips.</p>

<p>Again I say this sea is a fit emblem of Death.
Its water is bitter, and destitute of life. It is
locked in by fire-scorched and storm-beaten rocks.
Above it are a fierce sun and a brazen sky.
Silence reigns supreme. As the traveler walks
around the sea, his shadow is the only moving
thing he sees. If he chances to be attracted by
the song of a bird, or by a crow flying over the
water, it is only that the contrast may make death
and silence all the more impressive. Here is a
sea whose hollow fruit is ashes, whose miasmatic
breath is poison, whose moonlit waves are fire,
and whose significant name is Death!</p>

<p class="drop-capi15">NEAR the north end of the Dead Sea, there
rises up, towards the west, a mountain steep
and high. The base of this mountain is
hideously rough. Chasms and pitfalls are numerous.
Loose rocks and boulders are scattered
promiscuously around, while thorns, thistles, and
cactus plants everywhere abound. Higher up the
mountain there are not so many pitfalls; the
rocks and boulders are fewer and smaller, and the
thorns and thistles are by no means so numerous.
Here is a sprig of growing grass, and yonder is a
cluster of opening flowers. Straggling olive trees
are occasionally seen. In climbing the mountain,
one finds that the roughness gradually ceases,
while the grass, flowers and trees gradually increase
respectively in freshness, fragrance and
foliage. Continuing the ascent, the atmosphere
becomes purer, the prospect grows broader, and
the vision is increasingly beautiful.</p>

<p>Standing in the valley, I see two Russian pilgrims,
husband and wife, climbing this mountain.
They are all bowed down beneath the weight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
three score years and ten; their heads are white
with the accumulated frosts of seventy winters.
Their steps are slow and feeble, but on and up
they go. Now they are side by side; and now
the husband goes in front to remove, as best he
can, the rocks and boulders, the thorns and thistles,
from his wife’s pathway. See, they both
stop! What is the matter? They have come to a
boulder that they can not well surmount. What
is to be done? The wife puts her hand under the
husband’s elbow, and pushes him up on the rock.
Then he reaches back, and, catching hold of her
hand, pulls her up. Again he removes the rocks
and thorns from the wife’s pathway. Again she
helps him over some rough place, and he draws
her up after him. Now he goes out to the right
and left of the path, and plucks flowers for his
companion. Yonder they stand, high on the
mountain side, leaning on a rock, and resting
underneath an olive tree. They enjoy the pure
air and the wide expanse of vision. They talk
about the hardships they have undergone, and the
difficulties they have encountered. They look
back whence they have come, and then turn their
faces and their footsteps on towards Jerusalem,
whither they are going.</p>

<p>That is a picture of life. That’s the hill of life.
Pilgrims of life are we all. The base of life’s hill
is rough. Rocks and boulders are strewn broadcast.
Thorns and thistles grow promiscuously
around. Numberless traps and pitfalls beset the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
way. Many a young man knows all about these
rough places in life. His feet have been pricked
and pierced by the thorns and thistles. Traps
have been set for him. Chasms have yawned before
him, and pitfalls have gaped at his feet.
The moral atmosphere surrounding him is bad.
But no weakling he. There is iron in his blood,
phosphorus in his brain, fire in his bones, and
courage in his heart. He is a man! He says:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,<br />
Shall never sag with doubt or shake with fear.”</p>

<p class="p1">He asks the girl of his choice to wear his name,
and share his joys and sorrows. They have
nothing but a firm faith in God, and a loyal love
for each other. He leads her to Hymen’s altar,
and there the twain are made one. Now they
start up the hill of life, on the long, long pilgrimage.
They walk side by side&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Two souls with but a single thought,<br />
Two hearts that beat as one.”</p>

<p class="pn1">The way becomes rough. The husband goes in
front to ward off the danger, to remove rocks and
boulders, thorns and briers. He does all he can
to smooth his wife’s pathway. Now and then he
comes to some formidable obstacle that he can
not surmount. Here the wife, with her kindly
counsels, with her sympathy, co-operation and
prayers, pushes her husband up on the rock. The
poet says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Unless above himself he can<br />
Erect himself, how poor a thing is man!”</p>

<p class="pn1">The woman helps the man to “erect himself above
himself.” Then the man, if he be a man, draws
the woman up to his level.</p>

<p>As they climb life’s hill together, the roughness
decreases, the way becomes smoother. Instead
of the thorn, comes up the fir-tree; instead of the
brier, comes up the myrtle-tree. The moral atmosphere
grows purer, and the prospect more
pleasing. He constantly plucks flowers from the
garden of the heart, and weaves them into bouquets
for his companion. And, as Byron beautifully
says,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“These flowers of love make glad the garden of life.”</p>

<p class="p1">Standing high on life’s hillside, they lean on the
Rock of Ages, and rest under the olive-branch of
peace. Together they speak of their rough places
in life, about their sufferings and sorrows, their
troubles and triumphs. They look back at the
valley whence they have come, and then turn their
faces on towards the New Jerusalem, city of the
soul, to which they are journeying. Their steps
are growing slow and feeble. They lean on each
other, and both lean on Christ. They are approaching
the end of their pilgrimage. The
shadows of evening are falling long and deep
around them. Their white locks are streaming
in the winds of winter. Their latest sun is sinking
fast; but, sinking, he lights up the Star of Hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
and flings it out like a glorious chandelier to light
the pilgrims home to glory and to God. Ask <i>me</i>,
“Is life worth living?” I say, there’s the answer.
That’s the poetry of life. That’s</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The unruffled mirror of the loveliest dream<br />
That ever left the sky on the deep soul to beam.”</p>

<p class="p1">Do you say this is an ideal picture? Well, yes;
the latter part of it is; but ‘tis a fancy resting on
fact. Besides,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The beings of the mind are not of clay;<br />
Essentially immortal, they create<br />
And multiply in us a brighter ray<br />
And more beloved existence.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">FIVE miles south of Jerusalem, there are two
deep ravines, about a quarter of a mile
apart, running east and west, and parallel
to each other. The flat-topped ridge between
them, which is several hundred feet in altitude, is
terraced by nature on both sides. The terraces
are usually about ten feet high, and fourteen feet
deep. Not content to remain in the valley, the
ambitious olive climbs from terrace to terrace
until its green foliage crowns the historic brow of
the narrow ridge. Yes, historic is the right word.
On this ridge, Boaz lived; and in yonder broad
valley at its northern base, Ruth, the Moabitess,
“gleaned in the wheat fields.” Here Jesse lived
and David played. At the command of God, the
prophet Samuel came hither and annointed the
youthful shepherd lad as future king of Israel.
From here he went forth to fight Fate and Fortune,
Sin, Saul and Satan.</p>

<p>But there is yet another reason why this place
is historic, “for thus it is written by the prophet:
And thou, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, art
not the least among the princes of Judah; for out
of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my
people, Israel.” Caesar’s decree brought Joseph
and Mary to Bethlehem. While they were there,
God laid Jesus in Mary’s arms, and on the world’s
heart. That was a memorable night. The stars
dropped a bright light, and the angels a sweet
song, from the skies. The valleys were flooded
with light, and the hills were vocal with praise.
Shepherds left their flocks and went in search of
the new-born babe. The wise men of the East
mounted their white camels, and were guided
across the trackless sea of sand by the Star of
Bethlehem. O, Bethlehem! thou art indeed the
“house of bread;” and to thee the people of earth
look for spiritual food. As the nations learn
wisdom, they follow the example of the wise men
of the East, and seek thy child.</p>

<p>At present, Bethlehem has about 5,000 inhabitants,
most of whom are Catholics. The chief
industry of the place is the carving of pearl, wood,
and bitumen. These cunningly wrought relics are
sold to tourists from every clime and country.
All work is done by hand, and with the simplest
tools; and yet it is curious to see how nearly
these craftsmen have approximated perfection in
their art. Carving is nothing less than an art with
them. The town, antique, dilapidated and filthy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
though superior to most places in Palestine, is
built along on top of the ridge from east to west.
The most prominent object in the city is the
<i>Church of the Nativity</i> which occupies the eastern
terminus of the ridge.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">CAVE OF THE NATIVITY.</p>
</div></div>

<p>This immense structure, which was erected by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great, is
built over a natural grotto in the rock in which it
is generally believed Jesus was born. The building
is entered through the west end. The door
is small and very low; but no knee, I trow, is too
stiff to bend when entering a place so dear to
memory, and so closely related to human redemption.
Once through the door, we straighten ourselves
and walk slowly across the building. Near
the east end, we come to a flight of steps which
leads us down to a rock grotto, called the <i>Cave of
the Nativity</i>. This is forty by sixteen feet, and
ten feet high. The cave, no longer in its natural
or rude state, is now paved and lined throughout
with marble, many-colored and costly. Darkness
is driven out, and the underground room is illuminated,
by a score and a half of gold and silver
lamps that are kept perpetually burning. There
are niches, or recesses, in two of the walls of the
grotto. In one, there is a silver plate bearing
this inscription in Latin: “<i>Here was born of the
Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ the Savior of the
World</i>.”</p>

<p>In the other niche, there is a golden star, which
is said to mark the place above which the Star of
the East rested when the wise men sought for the
infant Christ. The feelings that a Christian experiences,
when standing or kneeling in this sacred
place, can not be translated into words. The
great deep of his soul is stirred to its profoundest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
depths; his eyes become safety valves, through
which the overflow of emotion escapes.</p>

</div></div>

<p>That Jesus was born in this cave, there is very
little room to doubt. On this point, Dr. Geike
expresses himself thus:</p>

<p>“As far back as the middle of the second century&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
is to say, within less than 120 years of
our Lord’s death, and within thirty or forty years
after that of the last of the apostles, the beloved
St. John&mdash;Justin Martyr, himself a man of Nablus,
speaks of the Savior’s birth as having taken place
‘in a certain cave very close to the village;’ and
this particular cave, now honored as the scene of
the Savior’s birth, was already so venerated in the
days of Hadrian that, to desecrate it, he caused a
grove sacred to Adonis to be planted over it, so
that the Syrian god might be worshipped on the
very spot&mdash;a form of idolatry peculiarly abhorrent
to the pure morals of Christianity. Origen, in
the opening of the third century, speaks of this
cave as recognised even by the heathen as the
birthplace of their Lord. And to this spot came
St. Jerome, making his home for thirty years in a
cave close by, that he might be near the birthplace
of his Master; Hadrian’s grove had been
destroyed sixteen years before his birth, to make
room for the very church now standing. There
is no reason therefore so far as I can see, to
doubt that in this cave, so hallowed by immemorial
veneration, the Great Event associated with
it actually took place.</p>

<p>“Nor is there any ground for hesitation because
it is a cave that is regarded as the sacred spot.
Nothing is more common in a Palestine village,
built on a hill, than to use as adjuncts of the
houses, the caves with which all the lime-stone
rocks of the country abound; making them the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
store-room, perhaps, or the work-shop, or the
stable, and building the dwellings before them so
as to join the two. Canon Tristram speaks of a
farm-house he visited, north of Acre, which was a
granary and stable below and a dwelling-place
above; and many stables in the neighborhood of
Bethlehem are still recesses cut in the rock, or
mere natural caves. In Egypt, I have often seen
houses where goats, sheep, cattle, or an ass, were
in one part, and the human beings in the other.
Had the piety of the monks left the alleged site
of the Nativity in its original state, there would
have been no presumption against it from its
being a cave.”</p>

<p>We go only two miles, after leaving Bethlehem
for Hebron, before coming to the justly celebrated
<i>Pools of Solomon</i>. These are three immense
reservoirs, situated in a narrow ravine called
<i>Wady Urtas</i>. This wady passes Bethlehem, and
finally empties its waters into the Sea of Death.
The first and smallest of the three pools is situated
at the head of the valley. It is 380 feet long,
235 feet wide, and 25 feet deep.</p>

<p>The second reservoir is about one hundred and
fifty feet down the valley from the first, and the
third the same distance below the second. Perpendicularly,
the second is twenty feet lower than
the first, and the third twenty feet lower than the
second. All three of these pools are walled and
paved with rock, and cemented. There are broad
stone steps leading down into each pool. The
three pools combined would equal a lake six and
one half acres broad, and thirty-eight feet deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>These pools are supplied with water from a
perennial fountain that bursts forth from the side
of a hill about two hundred yards northwest of
the upper pool. From this copious fountain, the
water is carried to the pools by means of an
aqueduct, the same aqueduct, by the way, that
carries water to Bethlehem and Jerusalem. The
most successful and scientific engineers of the
nineteenth century could suggest but little improvement
in these <i>Pools</i> and <i>Aqueducts of Solomon</i>,
which were constructed between three and
four thousand years ago.</p>

<p>The road from Jerusalem to Hebron leads directly
by these pools. Having satisfied our thirst,
and that of our beasts, let us press on toward
Hebron, which is eighteen miles south of us.</p>

<p>The soil and climate of southern Palestine
seem peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of
grapes. Of course, the vine is everywhere to be
found in this country, but between Bethlehem and
Beersheba it is cultivated with more care, and
yields more abundantly, than anywhere else.</p>

<p>Hebron, more than any other city in the Holy
Land, is associated with the name of Abraham.
This was the home of the Father of the Faithful.
The Arabs call Hebron <i>El Khalil</i>&mdash;<i>the friend</i>&mdash;because
Abraham lived here, and was <i>the friend of
God</i>. This was one of the chief cities of Palestine
during the Old Testament period; and, though
we hear nothing of it in the New Testament
times, it has again come into prominence. If
called on to name five of the largest and most
prosperous cities in the Holy Land, one could not
fail to mention Hebron. It has a population of
ten or twelve thousand souls, about half of whom
are Hebrews. Some signs of life are here. Traffic
is not dead in Hebron, as in most portions of the
country. The villages south, east, and west of
here do their trading in Hebron. Camels and
asses are constantly coming in, laden with wine,
raisins, dates, figs, wool, camels’ hair, and goat
skins. Out of these skins, leather bottles and
buckets are made. There is also a glass factory
here which is devoted chiefly to the manufacture
of colored beads, necklaces, bracelets and other
articles of female attire.</p>

<p>Hebron, which is half a mile long, and a quarter
of a mile wide, is built on the base of a mountain
which rises 2,000 feet above the upper edge of the
city. More interest attaches to the mosque than
to any other object in the place. But Jews and
Christians are alike excluded from this sacred
edifice. Because of the regal diadem suspended
above his brow, the Prince of Wales, was as a
mark of special honor, allowed to enter this
Mohammedan Holy of Holies. Dean Stanley
who was with the Prince of Wales, was also permitted
to tread the sacred court; and from his
pen has come the most complete and accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
description we have of this mosque, which, some
writers suppose, was built by Solomon.</p>

<p>A mile and a half from the city is <i>Abraham’s
Oak</i>. We are told that this is the tree under
which Abraham entertained the angels. This
story takes our credulity; but, while we can not
believe that this tree was here in Abraham’s day,
we must acknowledge its age. It is venerable in
appearance. It is, indeed, a patriarch of the
forest.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">LYING between the Dead Sea and the river
Jordan on the east, and the Mediterranean
on the west, and extending from Mount
Hermon on the north to the desert of Arabia on
the south, is a country whose influence has been
more far-reaching than that of any other country
on the globe. The influence that this country has
exerted upon the world is truly remarkable when
we consider the limited extent of its territory, and
the previous servile condition of the people who
made it famous. From the southern end of the
Dead Sea to Gaza, on the Mediterranean, the
distance is only sixty-five miles, while it is not
more than twenty-three miles from the Sea of
Galilee to Mt. Carmel. The average breadth of
the country does not exceed forty miles. Dan
and Beersheba stand respectively for the northern
and southern limits of Palestine; and these two
cities are not more than one hundred and sixty-five
miles apart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>“The whole area of the land of Palestine,” says
Dr. Robinson, “does not vary greatly from 12,000
geographical square miles,&mdash;about equal to the
area of the two states of Massachusetts and Connecticut.
Of this whole area, more than one-half,
or 7,000 square miles, being by far the most important
portion, lies on the west of the Jordan.”</p>

<p>This small land, inhabited by a feeble folk, who
for four hundred years had their necks galled by
the yoke of Egyptian bondage, has given to the
world a Church, a Creed, and a Christ! The
Church has carried the Creed into every land
under every sky. The Christ of Palestine has
become the Christ of the world; and wherever He
is enthroned idols fall and nations bow.</p>

<p>Small is the country, but important is the geographical
position. It has been called “the very
out-post on the extreme western edge of the East,
pushed forward, as it were, by the huge continent
of Asia.” Cut off from Asia by the desert, and
from Europe by the sea, Palestine stands alone.
And yet it was the door through which Asiatic
and European nations had to pass in order to
visit, trade with, or fight each other. There was
a constant stream of commerce flowing through
the country. Hostile armies frequently met upon
her hillsides, and watered her fertile valleys with
each other’s blood. It was therefore of the very
greatest importance as a strategical point. Thus,
by their unique geographical position, the inhabitants
of Palestine could, by staying at home, wield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
a most powerful influence upon the people of
Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>Again, close study reveals the fact that Palestine
is as unique <i>within itself</i> as it is in relation
to other countries. Within this small area, the
antipodes are brought together&mdash;the extremes of
earth meet. Palestine is a little world within
itself. In the valley of the Jordan there is perpetual
summer; and, consequently, tropical fruits,
a profusion of flowers, and a great variety of birds
and wild beasts are found. Only a few miles
away, Mount Hermon rises into the region of perpetual
snow. There the bear, and other animals
natural to a cold climate, take up their abode.
Palestine has its highlands and lowlands; its hill
country and valleys; its fertile plains and barren
deserts; its oceans, rivers and lakes; its fresh
water and salt; its flowing rivers and Dead Sea.
Within these narrow limits, therefore, is found
every variety of climate, soil and production, of
habit and occupation, of bird and beast.</p>

<p>We can see the wisdom, therefore, that God
displayed in selecting this as the home of His
chosen people. Here they were to live and learn;
here they were to mould national character, and
influence adjacent peoples; here they were to commune
with God, and write that Book which was
to be read on land and water, by fishermen and
farmers, by travelers on the desert and sailors on
the sea. Whether chilled by polar snows, or
scorched by tropical suns, we can all read that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
blessed Book with interest, pleasure and profit,
and feel at home with the writer.</p>

<p>This wonderful country is known by three
names. The first is Palestine from Palestina, the
land of the Philistines, literally, “the land of
the strangers, or of wanderers.” Originally, this
name was applied only to that part of the country
known as the marine plain, say from Jaffa to
Gaza, as that was pre-eminently the land of the
Philistines. Gradually, however, the word Palestine
was accepted as the name of the whole
country.</p>

<p>Canaan, or the Land of Canaan, is a second
name given to this particular country. Canaan
signifies “the low land,” or “the low country,” as
opposed to the “land of Gilead,” that is, the high
table-land the east of Jordan. It may at first
seem strange that a country so hilly and rough as
this should be called “the low land”; but it should
be borne in mind that the hills are a kind of a
mountain-chain running through the country from
north to south. Approaching the country <i>from
the west</i>, one is greatly impressed with the low,
broad, level marine plain which begins at Mt.
Carmel and extends far south of Gaza, getting
broader and broader towards the south. On
entering Palestine <i>from the east</i>, one is even more
impressed with the low valley, or deep ghor, of
the Jordan.</p>

<p>But no name seems so appropriate for this
country as “the <i>Holy Land</i>.” No explanation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
necessary; every one understands the reason for,
and recognizes the appropriateness of, this appellation.</p>

<p>Enough has been said, even in this chapter, to
give one some idea of the topography of the Holy
Land. Imagine a broad, level country one hundred
and sixty-five miles long, sixty miles wide at
one end, and twenty at the other. On one side
this country is bounded by a sea, and on the
other by a river. Now imagine that you build a
house through the centre of this long, narrow
country from one end to the other. Let the roof
come down to the ground on either side of the
house, leaving a broad plateau on either side, that
is, a wide valley between where the roof comes
to the ground and the borders of the country.
From the top of the house, or mountain ridge, to
the Mediterranean is 3,000 feet, while from its top
to the Jordan or Dead Sea is 4,000 feet. This
gives an approximately correct idea of Palestine.
But no one must for a moment suppose the
mountain ridge to be regular like the comb of a
house, or its sides smooth like a roof. From the
central ridge, a succession of peaks rise up to various
heights. Beginning at the south, the peaks
are Hebron, 3,029 feet above the Mediterranean;
Jerusalem, 2,610, and Mount of Olives, 2,724,
Bethel, 2,400; Ebal and Gerizim, 2,700; “little
Hermon” and Tabor (on the north side of the
plain of Esdraelon) 2,000; Safed, 2,775, and Jebel
Jurmuk, 4,000. To find the elevation of any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
these peaks above the Dead Sea, just add 1,300
feet to the height already given. These several
peaks mentioned are just about the centre of the
country from east to west. Sometimes the central
ridge is level on top, and we find a broad,
elevated table-land.</p>

<p>During the rainy season, which usually begins
with November and ends with March, a great
deal of water falls upon this mountain ridge. It
can not stay there, so, rolling itself up into torrents,
it courses down the steep sides with great
swiftness. This has continued for thousands of
years, until now the ridge on both sides is seamed,
threaded, cut, worn and ditched by these torrents
into almost every conceivable shape. The wadys
and ravines are not far apart, and are frequently
quite deep. So all through Palestine there are a
succession of ravines, running from east to west,
with rocky ridges steep and high between them.</p>

<p>One would naturally suppose that a country
like this would be barren and worthless; but not
so with Palestine. These mountain ridges are
of a lime-stone formation. In the summer, the
climate is exceedingly oppressive; the rays of the
sun are almost like streams of fire. The thermometer
rises in the day to 126 or 128 degrees.
The nights, even in midsummer, are cool and
pleasant. At noon day the mercury registers 128
degrees, and at night it falls to forty and forty-five
degrees. In the day, when the lime-stone rocks
become heated, they expand; and at night, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
cooled, they contract. They continue to expand
and contract until after awhile they fall to pieces&mdash;disintegration
takes place. This begets a great
quantity of finely pulverized lime-stone dust, which
is extremely rich and fertilizing. Nature, with
her ever watchful care, has so arranged these hills
as to enable them to catch, retain, and appropriate
most of this fertilizing dust. The hills are naturally
terraced. From base to summit we see one
terrace rising above another. They look like
huge steps placed there to enable giants to ascend.
If the people would only build up the
defective places in these terraces, they would
catch practically all of the dust caused by the
decaying rocks, and the country would become
richer and richer as the years pass by.</p>

<p>Palestine is still the “land of the vine and fig-tree.”
Every hillside is garnished over with olive
trees, as also with figs, dates, palms, and pomegranates.
The decaying rocks feed the hungry
trees they bear. This suggests a very important
question: What do the people of Palestine live
on? Now, as in Joshua’s time, “the tree of the
field is man’s life” (Deut. 20:19). The people
live largely on fruits. Olives, especially, are the
salvation of that country. The people here eat
the olive as we eat peaches. They also pickle
them; but the olive is chiefly valuable for the
excellent oil it yields. Olive oil is the only
seasoning these people have. Figs and dates are
likewise plentiful at all seasons of the year, in one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
form or another. The grapes of the Holy Land
are especially fine. They are abundant in quantity,
large in size, and deliciously flavored. There
is a grape here that makes very fine raisins, and
another that yields a superior quality of wine.
Wine here is usually mild. It is also plentiful,
and is used freely.</p>

<p>There are many valleys in this country that are
as rich and fertile as the alluvial deposits of the
Nile. Such, for instance, is the plain of Esdraelon
and the valley around Lake Huleh. These
garden spots are annually sown in wheat. To be
sure, the yield is not large. We can not expect it
to be large when we remember that these sons of
idleness use the same rude implements of agriculture
that their fathers used three thousand
years ago. A camel, or a yoke of oxen, a forked
stick, and a half-naked Arab, make a first class
plow team for Palestine.</p>

<p>The fact that these people are primitive in their
mode and manner of life, makes it all the more
delightful to the equestrian pilgrims to be here.
The student of history, especially of sacred history,
finds the same pleasure in traveling through
the Holy Land that a miner does in traversing a
rich gold field. The shining dust glittering in the
light of the sun stirs every faculty of his being;
and now and then, when he finds a nugget of
the precious metal, his soul is all aglow with
emotion.</p>

<p>Palestine is more than a gold mine, it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
diamond field, to the student of Biblical history.
New truths are constantly discovered, and old
ones are seen in a new light. Each additional ray
gives more beauty, and adds new lustre, to the
already resplendent gem.</p>

<p>To those who like novelty, and love Nature,
nothing can be more interesting than “tent life in
the East.” Here one is introduced into a world
of novelties. True, the country is old; but its
very age becomes a novelty. The mountains,
though shorn of their pristine beauty, though
“rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun,” have an
interest all their own. If the valleys were lakes,
and the hills clothed with verdure, Syria would
be only a repetition of the highlands of Scotland.
If the purple hills of Judea towered to the skies,
if they were covered with snow, and studded with
waving forest trees, the Palestine world would be
another Switzerland. If these people were Christianized,
civilized, and cultivated, they would differ
but little from Europeans and Americans.</p>

<p>But such is not the case. The lakes were never
here, and the primeval forests disappeared a thousand
years ago. Here the snow scarcely ever
falls, and the mountains are only hills, Hermon
and Tabor being the only exceptions. As for the
people, they are mostly Mohammedans and Jews.
Many of them never heard of Christ, nor do they
want to hear of Him. Nineteen-twentieths of
them are so illiterate that, if they were to see a
daily newspaper printed in their own language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
they could not read it. Not one in fifty could
write his name on paper if it would save his neck
from the halter.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. The following sentence is as
applicable as if it had been written with special
reference to this special country: “A land without
ruins is a land without memories; a land without
memories is a land without history. But twine a
few sad cypress leaves around the brow of any
land, and, be that land bleak, barren, and beautiless,
it becomes lovely in its consecrated coronet
of sorrow.” Palestine is a land of ruins. It is
strewn with ruins from one end to the other.
How could it be otherwise? Has it not been the
battle-ground of the nations. Did not Belshazzer
come hither from Babylon and Cyrus from Persia?
Did not Alexander come from Greece and Hannibal
from Carthage? How often did the Ptolemies
of Egypt, and the Caesars of Rome, march their
devastating legions through this fair land? Think,
too, of those brave knights of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, who fought as never men fought
before, trying to wrench this Holy Land from the
iron grasp of the Saracen and Moslem. That
was the darkest and bloodiest period of this
world’s history. This was the scene of action.
The very dust is historic. Every tree has heard
the tramp of armies, and felt the shock of battle.
Every stone has a tale to tell. In every community
there are stories many, and legends not a
few. Yes, Palestine is a “land of ruins.” It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
not a “few,” but many “sad cypress leaves twined
around its brow.” And, truly, it has become
“lovely in its consecrated coronet of sorrow.”</p>

<p>And more. All history is interesting, yet
“crosses and crucifixions take the deepest hold on
the hearts of men.” The word Palestine is inseparably
associated with that “name which is
above every name.” Here Christ was born; here
he lived; among the ancestors of these people he
“went about doing good.” In these waters He
was baptized; these hills were the pulpits from
which he preached His own everlasting gospel;
while the stones of the valley, the birds of the air,
and the lilies of the field, furnished Him with apt
illustrations to explain and enforce divine truth.
So in this Holy Land there are “memories which
make it holier, and a cross which is even in itself
an immortality!”</p>

<p>Hence I ask, “can any one who likes novelty,
and loves nature, who appreciates history, and
worships the Lord Jesus Christ, who has a head
on him, and a heart in him, fail to enjoy tent life
in the East,” or “five hundred miles in the saddle
through Palestine and Syria?” If any, speak;
for him have I offended. Not one; then none
have I offended. So let us be up and going,
taking a different route, and moving more rapidly
this time than before.</p>

<p>There were five in the original party, but I
gladly welcome the reader into our midst, saying
to him, “Come thou and go with us and be as eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
unto us, and we will do thee good.” Yes, “be as
eyes unto us.” We need some one to point out the
road, as much so as Moses did when he addressed
this language to his gray-headed father-in-law.
Indeed there are no roads in this part of Asia,
only dim bridle paths such as have been worn in
the rock by constant use for ages. Very few of
these people ever saw a wheeled vehicle of any
kind. Excepting four towns, there is not a buggy,
or a wagon, or even a wheel-barrow, in all Palestine
and Syria. There are no roads for them nor
for us. Hence we must travel on horseback.
Now that the reader has joined us, we are six in
number. Making calculations for the new comer,
we have eight tents, eighteen servants and muleteers,
and thirty-six head of horses, mules, and
donkeys. Of course, the mules and donkeys are
laden with tents and trunks, and beds and baggage,
and other things, for our comfort and convenience,
and their own board besides. They
look like young elephants with all this luggage on
their backs. Each of us has a riding suit, a
broad-brimmed hat, and a white umbrella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>While we eat breakfast in the morning, the
muleteers fold the tents and get things ready for
the road. Now Tolhamy, our Syrian dragoman,
mounts his Arabian steed and cries out, “Yal-la,
yal-la,” which means come on, come on. We
follow suit, and soon all are strung out across the
country like a band of wild Indians. The procession
is half a mile long. For a while the
pilgrims ride up and down the line, singing and
talking with the natives; then, plying the whip,
they leave the caravan behind. At noon, Abdo,
our Arab waiter, stretches the lunch tent, or
spreads the carpet under the grateful shade of an
olive grove. Lunch being over, we sit for an
hour or two reading the Bible and profane history,
talking about the battles fought in this
neighborhood, about what Christ and His apostles
did here, and about the confusion their miracles
and teaching must have caused among these
people. And, whether we lunched on Mt. Tabor,
whose heights are crowned with the ruins of a
crusader’s church, and at whose base Barak and
Deborah met Sisera in battle (Ju. 4: 14 and 15);
or at Endor where Saul called up the witch (1
Sam. 28); or at Joseph’s pit, from which he was
sold into Egypt (Gen. 27: 24-28): or at the
spring where Gideon’s brave band of three hundred
lapped before going against the Midianites
(Ju. 7): or at Cana, where our blessed Lord
turned water into wine (John 2: 1-11); or at
Nain, where He raised the man who was the only
son of a widowed mother (Luke 7: 11-17); or at
Jacob’s well, where He sat and told the woman all
things that ever she did (John 4: 6-26); whether
we lunch at one of these places, or the other, or
wherever we stop, we have a Bible in one hand,
and a history in the other, and always find enough
to interest and instruct us.</p>

<p>While we are resting, reading and talking, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
caravan passes by; so, when we come to the camp
in the evening, our tents are up ready to receive
us. We usually camp near a village, so as to get
water and to place ourselves under the protection
of the Sheik of the village. As soon as our tents
are pitched, the village is deserted&mdash;its half-naked,
filthy, and ignorant population having gathered
round our camp.</p>

<p>Supper being over, the muleteers, together with
the villagers, give some kind of an entertainment.
One night they have a marriage ceremony, then
an assessment and collection of taxes, an Arabic
tableau, or musical concert, without the music.
There is no music in an Arab’s soul! By this
we are on good terms with the natives; we go
home with them, go into their houses, talk with
them, find out how they live, what they think
about, so on. It is very seldom that we find a
family of five to eight occupying more than one
room, and often the goats, dogs and donkeys live
in the same room with the other part of the
family.</p>

<p>The people have no tables, no chairs, no bedsteads.
They sit on mats, and sleep on pallets of
straw. Whole families, sometimes ten to twelve in
number, eat out of the same bowl or pan. Knives
and forks are unknown. They live chiefly on
bread and fruits. Olives, figs and grapes are the
salvation of this country. The yield of olive oil
has been greater this year than usual. I spoke a
moment ago of an Asiatic village; but I am persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
that it deserves more than a mere mention.
I speak of the average village. It consists of a
hive of rough, rock huts one story, say six or
seven feet, high, circular, oblong, or triangular in
shape. The same low, flat roof frequently extends
over half or three-fourths of the town. There are
covered streets and lanes, winding around and
among the houses. A former traveler, whose
book a friend has just handed me, writes as
follows:</p>

<p>“A Syrian village is the sorriest sight one can
fancy. When you ride through one of them at
noonday, you first meet a melancholy dog that
looks up at you and silently begs that you will
not run over him, but he does not offer to get out
of your way. Next you meet a young boy without
any clothes on; and he holds out his hand and
says, ‘bachsheesh;’ but he really does not expect
a cent, for he learned to say that before he learned
to say ‘mother,’ and he can not break himself of
it. Next you meet a woman with a black veil
drawn over her face, and her bust exposed. Finally,
you meet several sore-eyed children, and
children in all stages of mutilation and decay;
and, sitting humbly in the dust, and all fringed
with filthy rags, is a poor human ruin whose arms
and legs are gnarled and twisted like grape vines.
These are all the people you are likely to see.
The balance of the population are asleep indoors,
or abroad, tending goats on the plains and on the
hillsides.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>If it is a little cold and damp, we gather around
the camp fire at night, and watch the glowing
flames as they crackle and leap into the air, and
fling their wild and weird shadows right and left.
Ah! what an artist these flames are. With one
bold stroke, they draw the outlines of a perfect
picture on the black canvas of night.</p>

<p>When it is clear and pleasant, as it usually is,
we go out in front of the tents, and talk and sing
and “consider the heavens.” And often, “as I sit
and gaze into the silent sky at night, and see the
myriad stars, they seem like camp fires, kindled
upon the plains of heaven, to light some wanderer
over the wastes and desolations of earth.”</p>

<p>It may be wrong, I suppose it is, but somehow
I envy the astronomer the pleasure he has in
reading the thoughts of God, as written in the
language of the stars. I wonder if the stars are
inhabited; if so, by men or angels? What becomes
of these creatures when a star “falls?” Dr.
Broadus would say that this is a good subject for
a public debate, as it can never be determined.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock, when the others retire to rest, I
take up my pen to record what has transpired
during the day. Often the swift footed hours
pass by before I know it, and I find myself writing
on “the other side of midnight.” But I can
not help it. In Palestine there is so much to see
and think about that one can not afford to sleep
more than five hours out of the twenty-four.
When at last my eyes grow heavy, I drop my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
leaden pen and fall asleep; and often I dream
about the objects and places I have seen during
the day.</p>

<p>At six, often at five, o’clock, I am up to hear the
morning warbler’s first hymn of praise. I find
that morning, rosy-fingered now as in the days of
Homer, “has yet a new and distant smile at every
rising.” Payne has well said that “no true lover
ever yet trysted with Nature in her own woods,
and by her own fountains, without seeing some
new beauty never seen before.”</p>

<p>We have been in this country now for months.
We have been many weeks on horseback. We
have made more than six hundred miles in the
saddle through Palestine and Syria, and yet it has
not become monotonous. Indeed, it grows on us;
there is a fascination about it. Each day is different
from the day before. The roads are different,
the people are different, the scenery is not the
same. New historical interests, new biblical characters
and sacred associations are hourly coming
up for conversation and thought. Josephus is no
longer dry and prosy. You read “Ben Hur,” and
“The Prince of the House of David,” with more
interest than ever before; last, and greatest, the
Bible&mdash;the Bible becomes a new book to you.
Its pages are brighter, its truths simpler, and its
Christ is more personal and real to you, than
before you came here. Palestine is a relief map
of the Bible. In our western world, a man may
be honestly skeptical; but, if he comes to Palestine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
as an earnest seeker after truth, he will soon dismiss
all doubt, and, like Thomas of old, cry out:
“My Lord, and my God!”</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">TO-MORROW the equestrian pilgrims will
pitch their tents on the holy hill of Zion.
It will be a time of rejoicing. I think that
each one of the party will put down in his diary.
“This is the happiest day of my life.”</p>

<p>The nearer we come to our journey’s end, the
more intense becomes the excitement. The night
before reaching the city, our tents are pitched in
a valley. “Coming events” have already begun
to “cast their shadows before them.” Each one
of the company is excited; each one filled with
life, hope, and anticipation. We all sing: “I’m a
pilgrim; I’m a stranger; this world is not my
home,” “I seek a city whose builder and maker is
God,” and “Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, my happy,
happy home.” At length, “weariness spreads her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
ever welcome couch,” and we fall asleep. Some
of us dream that Jerusalem is a “golden city.”</p>

<p>The leaden-footed hours of the night pass by.
About five o’clock in the morning,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Light breaks in upon my brain.<br />
’Tis the carol of a bird&mdash;<br />
The sweetest song ear ever heard.<br />
And mine are so thankful<br />
That my eyes run over with glad surprise.”</p>

<p class="p1">It is a nightingale, the queen of songsters. Perched
on a swaying limb, not far away, she flings her
merry notes into the sleeper’s tent. The little
warbler sings as if the heart of melody has been
broken on her tuneful tongue. Methinks it is the
sweetest song ever wafted to human ears on the
perfumed breezes of the night. It reminds one
of the time when the angel host sang to the
shepherds on the plains of Bethlehem. I can not
sleep. The morning star has dropped such a
bright light from the sky that it looks like day.</p>

<p>The pilgrims are up early enough to see the
stars, one by one, fade away. The sun rises clear
and bright above the eastern hills, and flings his
rays of light across a cloudless sky.</p>

<p>We are off earlier than usual. At ten o’clock
we ascend the brow of a hill, and “Zion, the city
of God,” bursts full upon our vision! Every horse
is stopped. Every head is uncovered. Not a
word is spoken. I can never forget the flood of
“sweetly solemn thoughts” that comes to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
during the calm of this holy hour. Oh! the thrill
of joy that goes through the soul of man when
he finds his prayers answered; when he realizes
that the toil and sacrifice of years have not been
in vain; when he sees the bud of hope ripen into
golden fruit! Only one person on this earth
knows what it cost me to come here. Would you
calculate the cost in money? As well undertake
to fathom the ocean with a fishing cord, or to
count the stars of heaven on your fingers and
toes! It cost&mdash;&mdash;!! But I forget all that,
when I behold Jerusalem, “The city of the great
King, beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole
earth.”</p>

<p>The Hebrew word, Jerusalem, probably means
“vision of peace,” and I have no doubt but that in
olden times the beauty of the city and the surrounding
country fully justified the name. It was
then “the joy of the whole earth;” but the Lord
hath covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud,
in his anger, and cast down, from heaven unto the
earth, the beauty of Israel. Jerusalem is withered,
like its emblem, the blighted fig-tree. It was once
a monument of the goodness, now of the severity,
of God. The city has been twenty-seven times
besieged, often taken, pillaged, and burnt. Occasionally
the very ground has been plowed up!
And yet “it is good to be here”&mdash;it is still a holy
city. Mount Moriah has not been removed, Calvary
is still on its base, and the Mount of Olives
is now just as it was when from it our blessed
Lord “was received up into heaven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been said, and truthfully, too, that Jerusalem
has occupied a more prominent place in
history than Athens, with all its arts, or Rome,
with all its arms; than Nineveh, with all its overgrown
power, or Babylon, with all its nameless
abominations. Jerusalem has done more to mould
the opinions, to animate the hopes, to decide the
creeds, and to influence the destinies, of humanity
than all other cities combined. Here Solomon
reigned. Here David sang, and Isaiah prophesied.
Here Christ the Lord lived, and taught us how to
live. Here, too, he was nailed to the tree, there
to die, “the Just for the unjust.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Watson, an earnest, devout, Christian lady
from Detroit, is a member of our party. As we
stand upon this hill and look upon Jerusalem for
the first time, she is completely overcome. Her
heart has melted within her, and is flowing freely
through her eyes. She weeps like a child, and
her tears do credit to her heart.</p>

<p>We camp in a beautiful olive grove on the
north side of the city. Our mail is soon brought.
After devouring letters, newspapers, and a hearty
lunch, I say to the party: “‘Walk about Zion; go
round about her; tell the towers thereof; mark
ye well her bulwarks; consider her palaces,&mdash;that
ye may tell it to’ your friends in America.” With
Bible in hand, with prayer and praise in our heart,
we are now ready to begin our “walk about Zion.”
It takes four eyes or more to see the beauty of a
picture, and four ears or more to extract the
melody from music. I shall therefore ask the
reader to join us in this walk about the “city of
the great king.”</p>

<p>We find the city perched, like an eagles nest,
among the hills of Judea. “As the mountains are
round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round
about them that fear him.” It stands 2,650 feet
above the level of the Mediterranean, and 3,800
feet above the Dead Sea. Imagine two ravines,
deep and narrow, coming together so that the
table-land between them forms the letter V, the
sharp point of the letter being to the south, while
the open part extends northward. Jerusalem is
built on such a V, though it does not run down
into the sharp point of the letter. The ravine, or
brook, on the east is Kedron, that on the west is
Hinnom. We find the city surrounded on all
sides by massive walls of stone, rising forty to
sixty feet above the ground. The east and west
walls run close along the edge of the chasms, so
that, coming up out of the valley to either one of
them, one would find it steep and difficult. The
south wall cuts off the sharp part of the V. The
north wall is much stronger than any of the
others, because that part of the city is not protected
by ravines, as are the other three sides.</p>

<p>We have now completed the circuit around the
walls of Zion, and in so doing we have walked
two and a half miles, and compassed an area of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
two hundred and nine acres of land. These walls,
some portions of which probably date from the
time of our Lord, are pierced by four gates; the
Damascus gate, on the north; Stephen’s gate, on
the east; on the south is the Zion, and on the
west, the Jaffa gate. Each one of these gates is
guarded day and night by Turkish soldiers.</p>

<p>Until recently there was another entrance to
the city&mdash;the Golden gate. This “gateway of
glory” entered the sacred enclosure from the east.
It was through this, supposedly, that our blessed
Lord made His triumphal entry into the Holy
City. This gate, a work of art, has been closed
up. And why? Because the Mohammedans fear
Christ. The Jews say that He is soon to come
out of the East, across the Mount of Olives,
through the Golden gate, into the Mosque of
Omar. Then He will overthrow the Mohammedan
government, proclaim himself king of the
Jews, and, subsequently, of the world. These
Jewish prophecies have aroused dread suspicions
in the Mohammedan mind, and to keep Christ
out of the city, the devotees of the false prophet
have actually barred up the gate with great stones.
These are fastened together with bolts and bars
of iron, steel, and brass. I am told that the
Mohammedans, especially during Jewish feasts,
even station guards at the Golden gate to prevent
the Messiah from entering the city.</p>

<p>I am rejoiced to know that I worship a Christ
who, when His time is fulfilled, will come. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
blessed be His name, He will come no more as
the Babe of Bethlehem; no more as the lowly
Nazarene; no more as the despised and rejected
of men. He will come as the glorified Son of
God, as Judge of all the earth. He will come
crowned and sceptred; robed in splendor; seated
upon the clouds, as a chariot of fire drawn by
angels of light. It was He of whom it was said:
“He openeth, and no man shutteth; he shutteth,
and no man openeth.” So, why need they try to
keep your Lord and mine out of His own city?</p>

<p>Before entering the gates, it will be well for us
to cross the brook Kedron, go over to the Mount
of Olives, and from there get a bird’s eye view of
the holy city. On the left, just after crossing the
Kedron, we come to the so-called tomb of the
Virgin Mary, over which has been built a Catholic
cathedral. In the cathedral, and around this
tomb, many candles and lamps are kept burning
day and night. By the flickering flame of these
tapers, turbaned monks constantly count their
beads and swing their censers. A hundred yards
down the valley, to the right, are the tombs of
Absalom, James, and Hezekiah.</p>

<p>From base to summit, the Mount of Olives is
garnished over with olive trees. Now, as through
past ages, the olives are gathered and poured into
a rock-hewn vat in the mountain side. The vat
before me is well filled. In it are an old, gray-bearded
man and a sprightly young maiden, walking
round and round, side by side, treading the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
olives with their bare feet, pressing out the oil.
This is rather a homely sight, but it suggests a
holy name. A name around which cluster many
tender and sacred associations. The word, Gethsemane,
means <i>oil-press</i>. Lifting my eyes from
the vat, I behold, about half way up the mountain
side, and a hundred yards to the right of the road,
the garden of Gethsemane, or the garden of the
oil-press.</p>

<p>This garden of prayer is at present surrounded
by a substantial rock wall ten or twelve feet high.
The entrance is through the upper or eastern
wall. The door, or gate, is scarcely three feet
high; but one is willing to bow and humble himself
on entering a garden so filled with holy
memories. Here Christ suffered and agonized
and prayed until “his sweat was, as it were, great
drops of blood falling to the ground.” Here
Judas betrayed the Master with a kiss. This
garden, which is 150 by 160 feet, is laid out in six
large flower beds, beautifully designed and well
kept. There are a dozen, or more of fir and olive
trees enclosed within these walls.</p>

<p>The superstitious monks, keeping the garden,
assure us that these are the identical trees under
which the Lord knelt and prayed. But my incredulous
mind entertains serious doubts on this
subject. In the first place, we are not sure that
the present garden is identical with the one that
our Lord frequented. We know, however, if the
two are not identical, they certainly are not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
removed from each other. Ever since the days
of Constantine (330, A. D.), the present garden
has been recognized as the place of agony and
betrayal.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">OLD OLIVE TREES IN GETHSEMANE.</p>
</div></div>

<p>I grant that our Lord was betrayed in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
garden, or another, probably not a stone’s throw
from it. I grant, also, that the olive trees are
remarkably long-lived, and that these within this
enclosure stand like patriarchs of their race, like
sentinels of the centuries past and gone. But
Josephus tells us that during the siege of Jerusalem
by Titus (A. D. 70), the Roman soldiers cut
down all of the trees around about Jerusalem.
Josephus was present during this siege. He wrote
from personal knowledge. And we can not accept
his statements without discrediting those of
the papal priests. But what care I? I pin my
faith to no rock, nor hang it upon the bough of
any olive tree. Somewhere on this mountain
side, probably near where I stand, the blessed
Lord drank the bitter cup. That is enough for me.</p>

<p>Bear in mind the fact that we are on the eastern
side of Jerusalem. We find the summit of Olivet
crowned with a large Russian convent. We go
up on the top of this convent. With our backs
toward Jerusalem, and our eyes toward the rising
sun, we look down upon the Dead Sea, 4,000 feet
below us, and in a straight line, only eighteen
miles away. The valley of the Jordan is plainly
seen, but its waters are not visible.</p>

<p>“About face.” We are now looking down on
the “City of David.” I say “down,” because the
Mount of Olives is two hundred feet higher than
Jerusalem, and the convent gives us an additional
elevation of fifty feet. Jerusalem is now spread
out before us like a map; and, although it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
three-fourths of a mile away, the atmosphere is so
pure that we can see it as plainly as if we were
standing on a tower in the midst of the city. It
is built on two hills, Mt. Zion and Mt. Moriah,
the former being a little to the west of, and a
few feet higher than, the latter. The intervening
valley, once very deep, is now so nearly filled up
that the two hills are practically one.</p>

<p>There is little variety about the architecture of
Jerusalem. The houses, generally, are built of
white stone, and are usually ten or twelve feet
high, with flat, stone roofs. Frequently one roof
extends over many houses. So, when viewed
from the Mount of Olives, Jerusalem has the appearance
of a broad sea of low, level, white roofs.
The monotony is relieved by five distinct objects
that lift themselves up above the surface and
stand out in bold relief.</p>

<p>These five objects of prominence are, first, the
Mosque of Omar on Mt. Moriah; second, the
Jewish Synagogue, beyond Moriah, on Mt. Zion;
third, Pilate’s Judgment Hall, or the Tower of
Antonio; fourth, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre;
fifth, the Tower of David, near the Jaffa
gate. These five towers and buildings lift their
haughty heads high above the humble structures
around them, and are clearly outlined against the
golden splendors of the evening sky.</p>

<p>The Mosque of Omar, standing on Mt. Moriah,
in the southeastern corner of the city, is by far
the most conspicuous of all. This marks the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
sight that was occupied by the old Jewish temple.
The Mosque is truly a gem of architecture, but
the Christian heart revolts at the idea of this
Mohammedan ensign of bigamy and bloodshed
standing where once stood the splendid temple of
Solomon. Alas! it is too true. But more of the
Mosque hereafter.</p>

<p>We came here to see the city; and when we
behold the churches and cathedrals, the mosques
and synagogues, the towers and minarets, rising
up here and there above the white stone buildings
around them, we are half inclined to believe
“Zion” is yet wreathed round with some of her
ancient glory. But candor compels me to say
that here, as at Constantinople, “distance lends
enchantment to the view.” I love a pretty picture,
and am always loath to break the mirror of admiration
into fragments of analysis; but it now
becomes us to descend the Mount of Olives, recross
the Kedron, and, entering by the Stephen’s
gate, to begin an inspection of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">STREET IN JERUSALEM.</p>
</div></div>

<p>We find the streets, which are from six to
twelve feet wide, paved with round stones, varying
all the way from a goose egg to a man’s head.
These stones are half buried in filth, the other
half being left exposed, and have been trodden
over until they are almost as smooth as glass.
No wheeled vehicle can enter the city, for the
reasons that the streets are too narrow to allow
a chariot or wagon to pass through; and if they
were wide enough, the stones are too sleek and
slippery for a camel to walk on, and, with safety,
draw a vehicle. You can follow one of these
streets, or lanes, only a short distance without
facing every point of the compass. In many
places you have to hold your nose, and carefully
pick your way through the dirt and filth. These
narrow, corkscrew streets (?) are lined on either
side by a lot of stalls, from five to ten feet wide,
called shops, or bazaars. Traffic seems to be at
a stand-still. The people are mostly idle. They
produce nothing, and consume&mdash;very little! Filth,
ignorance, and poverty, those emblems of Mohammedan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
rule, more unmistakeable than the Star
and Crescent itself, everywhere abound!</p>

<p>The population of Jerusalem is variously estimated,
the estimates ranging anywhere from 25,000
to 45,000. I think the city probably has 35,000
inhabitants, proportioned as follows: 18,000 Mohammedans,
12,000 Jews, and 5,000 Christians,
each occupying separate and distinct quarters of
the city. All the Christians, except a hundred
or more, are Catholics. While there are a few
wealthy Jew merchants and bankers in Jerusalem,
most of the Hebrews here are mainly supported
by a systematic benevolence, Jews in all parts of
the world contributing to this object.</p>

<p>There are many synagogues here, but only one
worthy of special note. The Jews have fifteen
or twenty theological students who daily assemble
in the chief synagogue, and seat themselves on
mats at the feet of their instructor, who sits on a
thick, deep-tufted cushion in the centre of the
circle. But there is no Gamaliel among the
teachers, no Paul among the pupils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">WAILING PLACE OF THE JEWS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Mosque of Omar is surrounded by a wall,
some thirty feet high, which cuts off thirty-five
acres, or one-fifth of the city. One part of this
wall has been identified, with more or less certainty,
as a portion of Solomon’s Temple&mdash;the
only remaining portion. It is believed that this
is the nearest approach to what was once the
Holy of Holies. Every Friday afternoon, at three
o’clock, the devout Jews of the city, old and young,
of high and low degree, assemble around these
sacred stones for worship. Here they chant the
Psalms of David, and read aloud from their
prayer books and Hebrew Bibles. They kiss,
and press themselves against, these stones for
hours. They weep and lament and pray and cry
aloud, as if their hearts would break. Hundreds
of these unfortunate children of Abraham assemble
at the “wailing-place.” When each one
has kissed the stones for probably a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
times or more, they all seat themselves flat down
on the stones in the dirt and filth.</p>

<p>Here they are, all seated in rows on the ground,
facing the wall, row behind row, until the last row
is forty or fifty feet from the wall. In the crowd
I see a mother and babe who remind me of
Hannah and Samuel. There, to the right, is a
tall, stoop-shouldered, old man, with grey hair and
a wrinkled brow. His long, white beard hangs
gracefully over his breast, and falls in his lap, as
he sits with uncovered head and bowed. That,
methinks, is a perfect picture of Abraham as he
sat weeping o’er Sarah’s grave. Here I can pick
out a Paul, yonder a John, an Andrew, and a
Peter. Ah! these are the remnants of a race
that have left their imprint upon every page of
human history. They sit and pray and weep, and
will not be comforted.</p>

<p>Close to the wall stand six Rabbis eight or ten
feet apart. With their palms upon the wall, they
repeatedly bend their elbows and kiss the stones.
And then, in a voice as sad as sadness’s very self,
they in concert cry out: “O Lord God Almighty,
thou has smitten us and scattered us abroad
among the heathen nations of earth; yet, O God,
will we praise and adore thee.”</p>

<p>The people, seated on the ground, sway to and
fro and cry out: “A-m-e-n, a-m-e-n.”</p>

<p>The Rabbis, still standing, kiss the wall and exclaim:
“Oh! for the Temple that is no more&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>Swaying to and fro, the people say: “We sit in
solitude and mourn.”</p>

<p>Rabbis. “Oh! for the Palace that is torn
down&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>People. “We sit in solitude and mourn.”</p>

<p>Rabbis. “Oh! for the walls that are demolished&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>People. “We sit in solitude and mourn.”</p>

<p>Rabbis. “Oh! for the great stones that are
burned into dust&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>People. “We sit in solitude and mourn.”</p>

<p>Rabbis. “Oh! for our kings and mighty men
that have fallen&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>People. “We sit in solitude and mourn.”</p>

<p>Rabbis. “Oh! for the glory that has departed;
oh! for the delay of thy coming&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>People. “We sit in solitude and mourn.”</p>

<p>Rabbis. “Come, yea, come, O Messiah! come
quickly. Enthrone thyself in Jerusalem. Reign
thou over us. Be thou our God. We will be thy
people, and thou shalt subdue the heathen nations
of earth.”</p>

<p>These Jews now, as did those in olden times,
cling with a death-like tenacity to the idea of a
temporal ruler. They forgot that Christ said,
“My kingdom is not of this world.” He once
“came to His own, and His own received Him
not;” and now they “sit in solitude and mourn.”</p>

<p>I have visited this “wailing-place” several times.
It is a pitiable sight. I see men, old men, men
patriarchal in appearance, barefooted, dressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
sackcloth and covered with ashes. They put their
mouths in the dust, and cry aloud unto God in a
most distressing manner.</p>

<p>It were enough to wring tears of blood from
the heart of a stone, to see a <i>nation</i> “smitten” and
“scattered” and “cursed” of God, as are the Jews.
Verily, they are cursed. They said, “Let His
blood be upon us and our children,” and so it <i>is</i>
upon them. They are homeless wanderers. They
have no common country, no flag they can call
their own. Wherever man has gone on land, or
ships on sea, the face and figure of the Jew are
seen; and always and everywhere he rests under
the curse of God. The blood is still upon him.
Truly, “it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands
of the living God.”</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, all these visitations
of wrath are in direct fulfillment of prophecy. In
his lamentations over the city, Jeremiah says:
“The Lord hath accomplished his fury; He hath
poured out His fierce anger, and hath kindled a
fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations
thereof. How doth the city sit solitary! How
hath she become a widow! The Lord hath afflicted
her for the multitude of her transgressions.
She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are
on her cheeks. Jerusalem hath grievously sinned;
therefore is she removed. Her filthiness is in
her skirts. Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and
there is none to comfort her. <i>All her people sigh
and seek bread.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>Reader, notice carefully the above sentence,
and then hold your breath as I tell you that every
morning, about nine o’clock, hundreds and hundreds
of Jews assemble at one place in the city,
and each receives a loaf of bread gratis; and that
bread, with what fruit he can get, keeps soul and
body together until next day. “Yea, they sigh
and seek bread.”</p>

<p>The prophet continues: “The Lord hath cast
off His Altar; He hath abhorred His sanctuary;
He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the
walls of her palaces. The elders of the daughters
of Zion sit on the ground and keep silence. They
have cast dust upon their heads. For the sins of
her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, that
have shed the blood of the Just One in the midst of
her, they have polluted themselves with blood, so
that men could not touch their garments.”</p>

<p>We should remember that these prophecies of
Jeremiah, and others just as striking from Isaiah,
were uttered hundreds of years before Christ was
born. And yet, as we read this Scripture to-day,
it sounds like history written yesterday. It is
literally fulfilled. The Hebrews <i>did</i> “slay the Just
One.” They <i>did</i> “pollute themselves with blood.”
Because of this, God <i>has</i> “poured out His wrath
upon them,” their city, and their country. Jerusalem
<i>has</i> been “removed,” and its “foundations”
<i>have</i> been “consumed with fire.” Her “filthiness”
<i>is</i> “in her skirts.” God <i>has</i> “cast off His altar,
and abhorred His sanctuary.” He <i>has</i> “given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
into the hand of the enemy the walls of the palaces,”
and to-day the children of Solomon have
to petition the rulers of a heathen government
for permission to approach the remaining wall of
their father’s Temple. To-day the people <i>actually</i>
“sit on the ground” with “tears on their cheeks.”
They <i>do actually</i> “sigh and seek for bread.”</p>

<p>Now I submit the question. Can any man,
who has a mind to think and a heart to feel, read
this Scripture, in the light of the present condition
of Jerusalem and of the Jews, without seeing
in it an unanswerable argument in favor of the
<i>inspiration</i> of the Bible? If the Old Testament
writers were not inspired, if they wrote as men,
and only as men, how was it that they could write
of future events, of events thousands of years in
the future, as though they were present or past?
There is only one rational conclusion to be reached,
and that is, that these men of old wrote as
they were moved by the Holy Spirit&mdash;that they
climbed high upon the Mt. of Inspiration, and
from there they, with the field-glass of prophecy,
scanned the whole horizon of knowledge.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi12">AS previously stated, an area of thirty-five
acres in the southeastern corner of Jerusalem
is surrounded by an extra wall. The
plot of ground thus cut off from the rest of the
city is, approximately, a parallelogram, and is
known as the Haram, or Sacred Inclosure. The
surface of the area is not exactly level, and was
formerly less so than at present. It was originally
highest at the northern end; thence it sloped
southward. From a longitudinal line running
through the centre of the inclosure, the surface
sloped also eastward and westward. This northern
elevation, which was of solid rock, has been
cut down twenty feet or more. The southern
end, and also the east and west sides, of the inclosure
have been considerably filled up. So,
evidently, the appearance of the Haram is materially
changed from what it once was.</p>

<p>The massive wall surrounding the Haram
serves as the rear wall of many of the dwelling-houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
of the city. These houses join each other,
and are all built close back against the Haram
wall, the top of the wall forming part of the floor
of the second story of the buildings. When the
houses are only one story high, the top of the
Haram wall is on a level with their flat roofs.</p>

<p>There are eight gateways leading into the
Haram, five through the western, and three
through the northern, wall. The numerous entrances,
however, by no means argue that the
Haram is easy of access. To enter this sacred
inclosure, a Christian must secure permission
from the Turkish authorities. Not knowing this,
I, all alone, start to the Haram through one of the
gates in the north wall. Just as I am about to
step in upon the sacred area, up spring three
Arabs with javelins in their hands, and daggers in
their eyes. As the Arabs draw their javelins, I
<i>with</i>draw my head.</p>

<p>Before making another attempt to enter, I obtain,
through the American Consul, the necessary
permission. The Consul also kindly sends his
Cavass, that is, his official body-guard, with me.
Going down David Street, we enter the Haram
through a gate about midway of the west wall.
Standing at this gate and looking directly eastward,
we see, about a hundred yards in front of
us, a broad, level platform paved with smooth,
white, marble-like lime-stone. The platform is
higher than we are, and must be reached by ascending
two long flights of marble steps. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
first flight brings us up on a broad, level terrace
which, to our right, supports several old olive and
cypress trees. Ascending the second stairway,
we find ourselves standing on the edge of the
paved platform already mentioned. We are now
face to face with the famous Mosque of Omar, or,
to speak more correctly, the Dome of the Rock.
Next to Mecca, this is the most sacred shrine in
the Mohammedan world. And, before leaving,
we shall find that it is not without interest to the
Jew, and also to the Christian.</p>

<p>The building is octagonal, each of its eight
sides being sixty-six feet long, and forty-six feet
high. Hence it is five hundred and twenty-eight
feet in circumference, and one hundred and
seventy-six in diameter. The walls, for the first
sixteen feet above the foundation, are made of, or
incased in, different-colored marble, the colors so
blending as to form beautifully designed panels.
The walls above the marble casing are built of
enamelled, or porcelain, tiles of various colors.
The blue, black, yellow, white, and green tiles are
interwoven with great artistic taste and skill.
Above the marble casing, each of the eight walls
has five tall, arched windows of richly-stained
glass. The walls are adorned here and there
with numerous quotations from the Koran, beautifully
inwrought in the tiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>The most striking feature of the external appearance
of this Mosque is the splendid dome
that gracefully rises from the centre of its flat
roof. The base, or drum, of the dome is twenty-seven
feet high, and is pierced by sixteen mosaic
windows. For oddity of design, delicacy of workmanship,
and beauty of effect, I have seldom seen
anything to equal these windows. McGarvey,
with his usual grace and eloquence, says: “This
dome is 65 feet in diameter at its base, and 97
feet high from the base to apex. The apex is 170
feet high from the ground. It is covered with
lead, almost black from exposure, and is surmounted
with a large gilt crescent. The peculiar
grace of the curve with which it springs from the
drum on which it rests, and that with which it
reaches its crescent-crowned apex, distinguish it
for beauty of outline from all other domes, perhaps,
in the world. From whatever point it is
viewed, whether from the Haram area, the city
wall, the Mount of Olives, or any other height
about the city, it is the most prominent and
pleasing object in Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>The Mosque has four doors, before reaching
any one of which, we must pass through a vestibule.
We enter from the east side. On reaching
the door, a tall Arab, patriarchal and reverential
in appearance, approaches and informs us that no
Mohammedan, much less a Frank, is allowed to
enter this <i>Haram es Sheriff</i>, this “Noble Sanctuary,”
with his shoes on. The patriarchal Arab
has a supply of slippers on hand which can be had
for a few piasters. Taking off our boots, we put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
on the rented slippers, and continue to examine
and admire the mighty structure.</p>

<p>The building, being eight-sided, is practically
round. Since coming on the inside, this is even
more noticeable than when we were without.
Within the building, and thirteen feet from the
wall, there is a large circle composed of eight
huge square piers and sixteen round columns&mdash;there
being two columns between each two piers.
The piers, or pillars, are built of different-colored
marble arranged in showy panels. The columns
are of the finest marble, and are so highly polished
that they reflect like mirrors. Each is crowned
with a Corinthian capital overlaid with gold.
From column to column, and also from column
to pier, there springs a beautifully rounded arch
built of marble blocks, alternately black and
white. These several arches furnish a strong
support to the roof above.</p>

<p>Nearer the centre of the building, and thirty
feet from the pillars just mentioned, there is an
inner and smaller circle, formed by four piers and
twelve columns, there being three columns between
each two of the pillars. The centre of each column
and pier in the outer circle is thirteen feet
from the wall. The columns of the inner circle
are likewise thirty feet from those in the outer
one. As from the columns and piers of the outer
circle, so also from those of the smaller one,
marble arches spring. These latter arches support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
the mighty dome, the exterior of which has
already been described.</p>

<p>Look now at the vast structure around you, at
the sunny dome above you! Look at the paneled
piers, at the mirror-like columns, at the gilded
capitals, at the marble arches adorned with rich
mosaics and bordered above with inscriptions
from the Koran beautifully wrought in interlaced
letters of burnished gold. It is evening. The sun
is sinking. Banks of golden clouds are floating
over the city. The airy dome above us seems
suspended in the air and belted with fire. The
stained windows in the dome receive, transmit,
and reflect the glowing light, until every part of
the “Noble Sanctuary” is flooded with golden fire.
In the language of Dr. Geikie, “There could, I
suppose, be no building more perfectly lovely
than the Mosque of Omar, more correctly known
as the Dome of the Rock.”</p>

<p>“Why is it called the Dome of the Rock?” the
reader asks. I am now ready to answer this
question. Within the inner circle of columns, and
directly underneath the dome, a huge rock rises
up through the floor. It is seven feet high, and is
fifty-three feet across! The whole edifice about
us was built in honor of this stone, and hence the
name of the structure&mdash;“The Dome of the Rock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">SOLOMON’S TEMPLE AS IT WAS.</p>
</div></div>

<p>“Why should this rock be so highly honored?”
For many reasons. It is honored alike by Jew,
Christian, and Mohammedan. According to tradition,
this rock was the summit of Mt. Moriah, and
on it Abraham offered up Isaac. It was on this
rock that Jacob saw the ladder extending from
earth to heaven on which angels were ascending
and descending. This rock was David’s threshing-floor
that he bought from the Jebusite. On it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
David built an altar and offered the sacrifice that
stayed the wrath of the angel, and thus saved the
city. Over this rock Solomon built his Temple.
On this rock Christ stood, when twelve years of
age, and confounded the doctors with His questions
and answers. On this same rock He stood,
in later life, and preached the riches of His own
everlasting gospel.</p>

<p>Since these traditions are wide-spread, and currently
believed, it is not at all strange that this
rock has imbedded itself in all Jewish and Christian
hearts. “But” says the reader, “there is nothing
in these stories, be they mythical or historical,
to enkindle in the Mohammedan heart a reverence
for this rock.” I admit your argument.
“Why then,” you ask, “did the Mohammedans
build the ‘Dome,’ and why does the Koran teach
that one prayer offered here is worth a <i>thousand</i>
offered elsewhere?”</p>

<p>Your questions are reasonable, and I will solve
the mystery for you. According to Moslem belief,
Mohammed was an incarnation of deity. From
this rock he ascended to heaven. He being a
divine personage, the rock did not want to leave
him. So, when Mohammed began the ascent, the
rock started up also. It would have gone on to
heaven with him, but Gabriel happened to be
present, and when the rock was only seven feet
high, he laid his hand upon it and stopped its upward
flight. Since that time the rock has remained
just where Gabriel left it. God performs a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
perpetual miracle by keeping the sacred rock
suspended in the air.</p>

<p>The superstitious followers of the false prophet
really believe these marvelous stories. They
show us the imprint that Gabriel’s fingers made
on the rock when, with a touch of his hand, he
stayed its upward flight. They show us also deep
impressions in the rock which, they affirm, were
made by Mohammed’s feet as he leaped from the
rock into the air! The fact that each impress is
as large as a peck measure causes Johnson to remark
Mohammed must have had at least a half
bushel of feet.</p>

<p>The Moslems believe, as before stated, that this
rock is suspended in the air, and we shall see how
the credulous creatures are taught to believe such
absurdities. Underneath the uplifted stone there
is an artificial chamber, twenty-four feet square,
and eight feet from floor to ceiling. The stone
walls are whitewashed, but the floor and ceiling
are left bare. This cavern is reached by a flight
of stairs which leads down from the edge of the
rock above. When devotees of the Arab prophet
come into the building, they are shown the famous
rock and told that it is suspended in the air. To
convince them of the truth of this statement, they
are brought down into this underground cavern.
Now, waving the burning candle above his head,
the attending dignitary says to the stranger: “Behold!
See for yourself! The rock above you has
no support. It rests on nothing. It is perpetually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
kept up by the Almighty God in honor of
Mohammed, His prophet.”</p>

<p>Stamping my foot upon the stone floor of this
rock-hewn chamber, and noticing the strange echo,
I say to the Mohammedan guard: “What means
this hollow sound? There is evidently another
cavern still below us. For what is it used?” The
astonished guide replies: “What is it used for?
Why, sir, the opening beneath us is the pit of
departed spirits. When a true believer dies, his
soul goes into this pit, and there he stays until
Mohammed reaches down and draws him out by
the hair of the head.”</p>

<p>Let the author remark, in this connection, that
an Arab regards it as the worst calamity that
could possibly befall him to marry some Delilah,
and have her clip his hair, or <i>pull it out</i>, and for
him to die before it grows out again. Should this
happen, Mohammed could get no hold upon his
slick head, and he would be lost forever. Mark
Twain comments on this, and closes by saying:
“The wicked scoundrels need not be so particular,
from the fact most of them are going to be
damned, matters not how they are barbered.”</p>

<p>It is not at all improbable that this secret chamber
contains objects of great interest to the Christian
world. When Herod’s temple was destroyed,
Titus, we are told, carried the golden candle-stick
to Rome. But the Ark of the Covenant was not
mentioned. The Ark was the most highly prized
thing on earth to the Hebrews. It is natural,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
therefore, that they should have done everything
possible to keep it out of the hands of the
Romans. To do this, it is supposed that the
pious Hebrews hid the Ark in some niche, or
corner, of the honey-combed rock underneath the
Temple. The Christian world would be glad to
explore the secret caverns under the Mosque of
Omar. But the Turkish government stands here,
like a fiery fiend waving a sword of vengeance,
saying: “Hands off. Stand back, or I will let this
sword fall upon your unprotected head.” And we
do stand back. But I believe the day will come
when the golden key of science will unlock all of
these closed doors, and when the electric light of
civilization will be turned on. Then will these
dark passages yield up their hoarded treasures to
the Christian Church, to the lovers of history, of
truth, and of God.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi10">IN giving a bird’s eye view of Jerusalem, I stated
that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
was one of the most prominent objects in the
city. This famous building is located about midway
the city, from east to west, but not more
than one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards
from the northern wall. It is, therefore, near the
Damascus gate. Although thus centrally situated,
although it covers an area of 200 by 230
feet, and although it lifts its double dome high in
the air, this church is frequently passed by without
attracting the slightest notice.</p>

<p>The reader naturally asks, “How is it possible
that a building at once so historic and prominent
as this attracts little or no attention?” The
question is easily answered. Except a few feet
on the south side, the structure is entirely surrounded
by other buildings that join close on to
it. These houses, which serve both for business
purposes and residences, are built one upon another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
until they reach high in air. The church is
thus almost entirely shut out from the view of
the street walker. To be seen externally, this edifice
must be viewed from the city walls, from the
Tower of David, from the Mosque of Omar, from
the hill on the west, or from the Mount of Olives,
on the east. When viewed from any one of these
elevations, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is
indeed prominent. From an architectural standpoint,
the building is “without form and void.”
But there it is, its two blue domes, like ever-open
eyes, of unequal size, continually staring you in
the face.</p>

<p>The building is owned jointly by the Latins,
the Greeks, the Armenians, and the Copts, each
sect having its separate chapels and apartments,
neither one being allowed to trespass upon the
rights of any of the others. The building proper
is owned by so-called Christian sects, as stated
above, but the <i>door is the property of the Mohammedans</i>!
And jealously do they guard their property.
The ponderous door works on rough hinges,
and is fastened with bolts of iron. But to open
it, the worshippers and even the priests who minister
at the altars, are compelled to use a golden
key. When the gold glitters, the door opens. To
avoid this unparalleled imposition, many priests
have actually taken up their abode in the sanctuary,
their meals being passed to them through
small apertures in the wall. The people are not
so fortunate as the priests. They can not live in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
seclusion. They must work for bread and blanket,
for Church and children. It is all they can do to
keep soul and body together, yet will they divide
their scanty living with the Mohammedans who
own the door of the Sepulchre.</p>

<p>Does the reader ask, “Why do they not worship
elsewhere, and save their money?” The answer is
twofold. The priests are in the church; and with
a catholic there is no prayer without penance, no
pardon without a priest. Besides, they are taught
to believe that this church is a peculiarly sacred
place; that within this building is the geographical
centre of the earth. A stone pillar marks the
central spot. Here God got the dust to make
Adam. Here, also, is Adam’s grave. Here was
caught the ram that Abraham sacrificed on the
altar of burnt offering instead of Isaac. Within
this building is a stone prison where Christ was
confined, Calvary, where he was crucified, the
Sepulchre, where he was buried. They point
out the graves of Nicodemus, and Joseph of
Arimathea. These places are all crowded together
under one roof; and yet they are pointed
out by the Latin priests with an air of certainty
that seems to say: “I have told you the truth.
To doubt is to be damned.”</p>

<p>The building is not <i>on</i> Calvary, but <i>over</i> it. As
if one would turn a tea-cup bottom upwards, and
then turn a large glass globe over that. The
floor of the building accommodates itself to the
rough surface of the mount. So the mount is entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
covered up, and one no more realizes that
he is about Calvary than if he were in Tremont
Temple, in Boston. Entering the door from the
south, one sees the Stone of Anointing directly in
front of him, and about fifteen feet away. This
marble slab is raised about twelve inches from
the floor, and rests on a wooden block. It is also
covered by wooden planks, so only the edge of
the stone is visible. The stone had to be covered
to keep the superstitious Catholics from kissing
it away.</p>

<p>Turning now to the left, we find that the building
resembles a large rotunda. Near the centre
of the rotunda we see a small building, twenty-six
by sixteen feet, and fifteen feet high. This small
building is a thing of beauty. It is made of
many-colored marble, richly polished and elaborately
carved. It looks like the model of some
magnificent cathedral. It is divided into two
rooms, the first being sixteen feet, and the second
ten feet long. The larger room is called the
Chapel of the Angels, while the second is said to
contain the Sepulchre of our Lord. The two
rooms are lighted day and night by fifty-three
gold and silver lamps. Numerous candles are
also kept burning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>Christmas morning, thousands of Greek Christians
crowd in and around the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre. The Greek Patriarch enters this
small structure, and extinguishes all the lamps
and candles. Silence and awe fall upon the multitude,
each of whom has an unlighted candle in
his hand. Suddenly the Patriarch from within
announces that he has received fresh fire from
Heaven. The Patriarch stands at a small opening
in the marble wall with the sacred fire in his hand.
The frenzied crowd vie with each other, each trying
to light his taper first. One man ignites his
candle from the Patriarch’s fire, and a dozen
others light from him. Presently, a deafening
shout goes up from the excited multitude. Every
man waves a burning taper above his head. The
whole scene resembles a restless sea of flame.
Expert horsemen now leap upon swift-footed
coursers which have been held in waiting. The
new-fallen fire is conveyed to different parts of
the country. Ships are at Jaffa to bear the
Heavenly gift to Greece and Russia. This sacred
flame burns continually in the Greek churches
until next Christmas, at which time this shameful
imposition will again be practiced on the superstitious
people.</p>

<p>Ascending a flight of stairs, we find ourselves
on what is falsely called Calvary. Removing a
few planks in the floor, the priest shows the bare
top of Calvary, the round holes in the mountain
where the three crosses stood, and the rent in the
rock, which was caused by the convulsion of nature
at the time of the Crucifixion. And many other
things they show us, whereof if I should write,
this book would not hold all I should say.</p>

<p>Now, if we had time, we might spend two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
three days, pleasantly and profitably, <i>down under</i>
the city. For, be it understood, that these hills
on which Jerusalem is built are honey-combed
with ancient stables, caves, caverns, quarries, catacombs,
and other subterranean passages. Captain
Warren, chief agent of the Palestine Exploration
Fund, is my authority for saying that Jerusalem,
so far as catacombs and underground passages
are concerned, is far richer than Constantinople,
Paris, or even Rome itself.</p>

<p>Just outside of the north wall, and a little to
the east of the Damascus gate, we enter through
an iron-barred door into a great cavern, known
as Solomon’s Quarry or the quarry out of which
Solomon got the stones to build his Temple.
With a strong body-guard, and a dozen or more
burning tapers, we wander for hours and hours in
this underground world, which in many respects
rivals Mammoth Cave. It is co-extensive with
the city above. A forest of natural columns support
the ceiling, which in many places is exceedingly
high. Here and there, we find huge blocks
of detached stone, which were long ago dressed,
but never removed from the quarry. They were
probably dressed by Solomon’s workmen, but
were never honored with a place in his splendid
Temple. That this was at one time a quarry, is
evident from the abundance of stone chips and
fragments that everywhere abound. In this cave,
it is claimed, the Masonic order was organized.
It has no river of eyeless fish, as has the Kentucky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Cave, but it boasts a never-failing spring of pure
and sparkling water. Think of all this underneath
the Holy City! O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, there is
none like thee in all the earth!</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">POOL OF SILOAM.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On the white ceiling above me, I wrote with the
smoke of my candle, “God is love.” I sang, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
the music went ringing and reverberating adown
the long, winding labyrinths of rock as I sang:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Rock of Ages, cleft for me,<br />
Let me hide myself in Thee.”</p>

<p class="p1">Leaving this cave, let us now go down south of
the city. Just where the two ravines meet, we
come to the Pool of Siloam. Here our Blessed
Lord once spat upon the ground, made clay of
the spittle, anointed a blind man’s eyes, and told
him to wash in this Pool of Siloam. The man
did wash his eyes, and at once received sight for
blindness. The Pool is preserved to this day.
Its length is fifty feet. It is fourteen feet wide at
one end, and seventeen at the other, and has a
depth of eighteen feet. It is walled up with rock.
A flight of stone steps leads down into it from the
southern end. Rev. Mr. El Kary, of Shechem,
the only Baptist preacher in Palestine and Syria,
was baptised in this Pool. It is now partially
filled up with mud; still it contains a considerable
quantity of water, and I go down into it and
bathe my face.</p>

<p>In the valley, below the Pool, is a large vegetable
garden and olive orchard. Vegetation luxuriates
in this rich valley, which is constantly
supplied, by means of irrigation, with water from
the Pool of Siloam.</p>

<p>The ravine east of Jerusalem, the one which
separates the city from the Mount of Olives, is
known as <i>The Brook Kedron</i>. But the lower end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
of this “brook,” near the Pool of Siloam, is called
The Valley of Jehoshaphat. This is the Jewish
cemetery. The valley and the mountain sides on
either side of the brook is one vast graveyard,
and it is bristling thick with white stone slabs,
which serve as head-boards to the graves. Jews
from all parts of the world are constantly coming
back here to be buried. According to their belief,
the Final Judgment will take place in this
Valley of Jehoshaphat. They say the name is significant&mdash;Jehoshaphat,
“Jehovah judgeth.” They
quote Joel III: 2 and 12&mdash;“I will also gather all
nations, and will bring them down into the valley
of Jehoshaphat.” “Let the heathen be awakened,
and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for
there will I sit to judge all the heathen around
about.”</p>

<p>Continuing up this valley, we soon come to the
tombs of Zachariah, Absalom, and St. James,
which were mentioned in a previous chapter.
Passing these by, we follow the valley northward
for a mile or more, and finally come to the celebrated
<i>Tombs of the Kings</i>. The peculiar construction
of these tombs, as well as the historical
interest attaching to them, entitles them to a
more elaborate description than my limited space
will allow.</p>

<p>Reader, imagine that you are standing with me
on a broad, level shelf of rock. Approaching its
centre, we see what might be called a huge cistern,
ninety feet square, hewn into the rock to a depth
of twenty feet. A long flight of broad, stone
steps leads us down into this excavation, whose
rocky walls are perpendicular. A door, cut in the
south wall, conducts us into a series of rock-hewn
chambers. With lighted candles, we pass into the
first room, thence through a small door to the
second, the third, and so on. All these chambers
are honey-combed with vaults, cut in the rock, for
the reception of the ancient dead. This underground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
mansion of the dead extends seventy-five
feet from north to south, and fifty feet from east
to west. It is a perfect network of rooms. The
ceiling is elaborately adorned with carved wreaths
and roses, with vines, leaves, trees, and fruits.
Everywhere the chisel has left undeniable evidence
of the sculptor’s skill. The outside door is
usually closed by a large flat, circular stone, which
looks much like a wheel, or a block sawn off of the
end of a log. Before entering, we have to “roll
the stone away from the door of the Sepulchre.”</p>

<p>Let us now return to the Pool of Siloam, and
walk up the other ravine, which is known as the
<i>Valley of Hinnom</i>. Of this valley, Doctor Geikie,
who is always a safe man to quote from, says:
“Israelites once offered their children to Moloch,
and these very rocks on each side have echoed
the screams of the innocent victims, and reverberated
with the chants and drums of the priests,
raised to drown the cries of agony. It is well
called the Valley of Hinnom&mdash;‘the Valley of the
Groans of the Children:’ a name which perpetrates
the horror once excited by the scenes it
witnessed; especially, it would seem, in this lower
part. Here, under Ahaz, Manasseh, and Amon,
the hideous ox-headed human figure of Moloch&mdash;the
summer sun in his glowing and withering
might&mdash;was raised in brass and copper, with extended
arms, on which were laid, helplessly bound,
the children given up by their parents ‘to pass
through the fire’ to him; a heated furnace behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
the idol sending its flames through the hollow
limbs, till the innocents writhed off into a burning
fire beneath. Ahaz and Manasseh had set a royal
example in this horrible travesty of worship, by
burning alive some of their own children; and
what kings did commoners would be ready to
copy. In later times the very words Ge-Hinnom&mdash;‘the
Valley of Hinnom’&mdash;slightly changed
into Gehenna, became the common name for hell.
The destruction of Assyria is pictured by Isaiah
as a huge funeral pile, ‘deep and large,’ with
‘much wood,’ ‘prepared for the king,’ and kindled
by the breath of Jehovah, as if by ‘a stream of
brimstone.’ Jeremiah speaks of ‘high places’ in
this valley, as if children had been burned on different
altars; and he can think of no more vivid
image of the curse impending over Jerusalem
than that it should become an abomination before
God, like this accursed place.”</p>

<p>In this same valley are two pools, known as the
Upper and Lower Pools of Gihon. The lower
and larger of the two is near the southwest corner
of the city. This immense reservoir is, approximately,
600 feet long, 160 feet broad, and 40 feet
deep. It has a capacity for 19,000,000 gallons.
The other pool is about three hundred yards
farther up the valley. It, also, is very large, but
not so capacious as the lower one. From this
Upper Pool of Gihon, water is conveyed through
an aqueduct to the different pools in the city, of
which there are quite a number.</p>

<p>Standing on the city wall just above the Damascus
gate, and looking directly north, we see,
about two hundred yards away, a mount rising up
somewhat higher than we are. It looks like the
upturned face of a man. We see first the chin,
then the eyeless sockets, and then the forehead
beyond. It is Golgotha, the place of a skull.
Here is where the world’s greatest tragedy occurred.
No mark is left to show where the cross
stood; yet Calvary has become the centre of the
world’s thought.</p>

<p>Some two hundred and fifty yards west of Calvary,
there are some tombs cut in the solid rock.
One of these has been pointed out by Captain
Conder as the probable one in which our blessed
Lord lay for three days and nights. When we
remember that Captain Conder is a scientist of a
high order, that he has been in Palestine twenty
years, sometimes with twenty and sometimes with
forty men with and under him, searching out
ancient names, places, and history, we must acknowledge
that he is good authority on these
subjects. Of this tomb, he says: “It would be bold
to hazard the suggestion that the single Jewish
sepulchre thus found, which dates from about the
time of Christ, is indeed the tomb in the garden,
nigh unto the place called Golgotha, which belonged
to the rich Joseph of Arimathaea. Yet its
appearance, so near the old place of execution,
and so far from the other old cemeteries of the
city, is extremely remarkable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe God has wisely and purposely hidden
these places from His children. He knows our
imperfections. He knows we would make too
much of crosses and tombs. He wants us to
think more of Him who died on the cross, and
rose from the tomb, who ascended on high, sat
down at the right hand of the Father, and ever
liveth to make intercession for us.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi10">JAFFA, “the high,” or “the beautiful,” situated
on the Mediterranean, forty-two miles from
Jerusalem, is the principal seaport in Palestine.
It has always been a favorite shipping
point. From here, Jonah started on that famous
voyage that ended on the inside of a whale. Not
until the time of the Maccabees, second century
before Christ, did Jaffa, ancient Joppa, fall into
the hands of the Jews. Soon, however, it was
wrenched from them by the Romans. Augustus
returned it to them. “Since then,” Doctor Geikie
remarks, “its fortunes have been various; now
Roman, next Saracen, next under the Crusaders,
then under the Mamelukes of Egypt, and next
under the Turks, to whom, to its misfortune, it
still belongs.”</p>

<p>It was here that Napoleon I. had several thousand
Arab prisoners of war shot. The great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
chieftain has been severely censured for this
“cold-blooded murder.” I am not sure, however,
but that his “cold-blooded” critics are as heartless
in stabbing him with the pen, as he was in
ordering those Arabs executed. He was thousands
of miles from home. He had no provisions
to feed, and no men to guard, the prisoners. To
turn them loose was to strengthen the enemy, who
already outnumbered him ten to one. In the name
of Mars, I ask, what else could Napoleon do?</p>

<p>While in Joppa, staying with one Simon a tanner,
who lived by the seaside, Peter went upon
the housetop and, in a vision, saw a sheet let
down from Heaven, filled with all manner of four
footed beasts. There is to-day in Jaffa a tannery,
by the seaside. The stone vats are exceedingly
old. The most pleasant place in Jaffa is on the
housetops. Standing upon the flat roof of the
house in the tan-yard, I easily throw pebbles into
the Sea.</p>

<p>Jaffa is worthy of her name. Situated in the
midst of an extensive orange orchard, which
slopes at first steeply, and then gently, up from
the water’s edge, she may well be called, “The
Beautiful.” I have eaten oranges in different
countries, but nowhere have I found them so delicately
and deliciously flavored as here in Jaffa.
The orchard stretches itself along the seashore
for two miles, or more, and extends about the
same distance back towards the hill-country.
Not oranges only, but figs, dates, pomegranates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
pears, peaches, bananas, apricots and other tropical
fruits flourish about Jaffa. This is a great
summer resort for the people of Bethlehem, Nazareth,
and Jerusalem. And why should it not be?
The sea breeze is refreshing, the foliage of the
orange trees is always green, and the blossoms
always fragrant. The ten thousand people who
live in Jaffa walk through filthy streets, and live
in sorry houses, many of them in miserable huts.
They are not, however, so poverty-stricken as are
their kinsmen in other portions of the country,
for the showers of golden fruit are constantly
bringing streams of golden coin into the Beautiful
City.</p>

<p>With pockets full of oranges, and hearts full of
gratitude that God has graciously permitted us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
to traverse the Holy Land from Dan to Beersheba,
and from the river to the Great Sea, we take
shipping at Jaffa for the land of the Pharaohs.
The voyage is rendered thoroughly uncomfortable
because of a cargo of sheep. The helpless
creatures are crowded together almost as if they
were cut up and salted down as mutton. During
a rough sea, they are so shaken up and jostled
together that they, like Peter’s wife’s mother, lie
sick of a fever. The fumes arising from these
fevered victims have a most distressing effect
upon the passengers. But for the sea breeze, we
should all go crazy, or should ourselves die of the
fever. Night brings no sleep to our pillows, no
relief to our throbbing temples. I feel that I
would almost be glad to be thrown overboard,
like Jonah, and trust to some passing whale to
carry me ashore. It is therefore with great pleasure
that we step off of this sheep-cursed ship on
Egyptian soil, in Port Said, at the mouth of the
Suez Canal. Port Said, which now has five to
eight thousand inhabitants, has been built since
the opening of the Suez Canal which, as the
reader knows, connects the Mediterranean and
Red seas. It is, perhaps, according to its length,
the most important stream or “connecting body”
of water in the world.</p>

<p>Leaving Port Said on a steamer, I soon find
myself gliding through this Canal, whose construction
is regarded as one of the grandest
triumphs of modern science. Great banks of sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
rise on either side, and the blue sky stretches
above our merchant ship. We are constantly
passing large merchant ships going to south Africa
and to India, and meeting others coming from
there. Every few hundred yards, we see a dredging
machine at work deepening and widening the
Canal. The desert sands are ever encroaching
upon it. I believe it will finally have to be walled
up with rock. The Suez Canal was opened, more
than twenty years ago, in the presence of representatives
of nearly every civilized government.
It is 110 miles long, 26 feet deep, 72 feet wide at
the bottom, and 140 feet at the top, and was constructed
at a cost of almost one hundred million
dollars. “The great advantage of the Canal,”
says the <i>London Times</i>, “is, of course, the decrease
of the distance to be traveled between Europe
and India; for, while it is about 11,200 miles from
London or Hamburg, by the Cape of Good Hope,
to Bombay, by the Suez it is only 6,332. This
reduces the voyage by twenty-four days. From
Marseilles or Genoa, a saving of thirty days is
effected, and from Trieste thirty-seven.” The
rates at which steamers are allowed to pass is
from five to six miles per hour.</p>

<p>While the French furnished the brains and the
money for the construction of the Canal, it is at
present chiefly owned by Great Britain, Disraeli
having bought up a great part of the stock,
when considerably below par, for 4,000,000 pounds.
Since that time, however, the value has increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
to nearly 11,000,000 pounds. It was, therefore, a
paying investment. Out of every one hundred
vessels passing this way, seventy-five of them belong
to England. The Canal is jealously guarded
by English forts and English men-of-war. The
British Lion has laid his paw upon Egypt,
and ere long a change will come over the spirit
of somebody’s dreams.</p>

<p>Passing through the land of Goshen, where
Israel dwelt, then through a series of lakes, and
finally by the town of Suez, we enter the Red Sea.
There is more life in or on this sea than around
its waters. Nevertheless, it is of surpassing interest
to the students of sacred and profane history.
The place where Moses led the children of Israel
across the sea can not be determined with certainty.
The authorities are about equally divided
between each of two places. Pharaoh and his
host were swallowed up by the sea, and no one
has ever thought enough of them even to fish for
their chariot wheels. A thinking man, with a devout
heart in him, trembles as he stands upon the
shore of this sea, and reads the thirteenth and
fourteenth chapters of Exodus, and especially
when in the vicinity of Mount Sinai he reads the
nineteenth and twentieth chapters.</p>

<p>Returning to Suez, we find a rude contrivance,
by courtesy called a train, which makes occasional
trips to Cairo. It is by all odds the most
uncomfortable “clap-trap” I have ever been in.
It is constructed much after the order of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
cattle-cars. During the trip, we encounter a sand
storm and are almost suffocated. I suppose, however,
I should do like other folk, and praise the
bridge that brings me over safely.</p>

<p>At all events, I am now in Egypt, the oldest
country in the world, the cradle of civilization.
It is here that the god of thought first waved his
enchanted wand, and separated intellectual light
from the long night of ignorance. I am in Cairo,
the capital of Egypt, and, next to Damascus, the
most exclusively Oriental city in the Levant. It
is still the city of “Arabian Nights.” It is as Eastern
and as odd now as when “Raselas” roamed
through its streets. I should like to describe Cairo,
with its mosques and minarets, with its flower
gardens and palm groves, with its narrow streets
and curious bazaars, thronged and crowded with a
moving mass of turbaned men and veiled women.</p>

<p>I should like especially to speak of my trip up
the Nile, of my visits to the place where it is said
Pharaoh’s daughter “came down to wash
herself in the river,” and found Moses in the ark
of bulrushes (Ex. XI: 1-10), to the Virgin’s tree,
in the ward where it is claimed that Joseph and
Mary lived during their stay in Egypt, to the
petrified forests, and to other places of interest;
but Time, that restless, sleepless, ever-watchful
tyrant, forbids. If I were Joshua, I would command
the sun to stand still while I finish this
chapter. As that is impossible, I will do the next
best thing&mdash;turn my watch back half an hour, and
write on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span></p>

<p>Peculiar interest attaches to the museum of
this place, because of its mummies. The old
Egyptians could not paint a beautiful picture, or
chisel a graceful statue, but they certainly knew
how to embalm and preserve the human body.
Let us pass by the “common dead,” and go at
once into the Hall of Royal Mummies. Here we
find the almost perfectly preserved bodies of twelve
or fifteen of Egypt’s kings. Among them is the
mummy of Rameses II., the Pharaoh who ruled
at the time when Moses was born. All these
mummies are, of course, in air tight glass cases,
but are plainly visible. Rameses II. was a man
of powerful physique, a small head which is full in
front, heavy features and hard. Albeit, his face
betokens strength of character and an iron will.
There is a far away, dreamy appearance playing
over his countenance. He looks as if he is thinking
about the past. We will not disturb his
peaceful slumbers. We come next into the presence
of His Royal Highness, King So Karimsap,
who is thus labelled: “This is the oldest known
mummy and is probably 5,700 years old.” As the
king has rather a pleasant and familiar looking
face, I presume to speak to him. I say:</p>

<p>“If your Royal Highness will have the goodness
to excuse a stranger, I should like to ask you a
few questions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quite excusable, sir, proceed,” is the fancied
reply.</p>

<p>Question. “While ruling Egypt of old, you
were much honored and revered by your subjects.
Why, then, did you decide to change your mode
of existence?”</p>

<p>Reply&mdash;</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The boast of Heraldry, the pomp of Pow’r,<br />
And all that Beauty, all that Wealth e’er gave,<br />
Await, alike, th’ inevitable hour;<br />
The paths of Glory lead but to the grave.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Do you receive the same reverence and homage
now as when you occupied the throne of
Egypt?”</p>

<p>“No; in the world of departed spirits, where
I now dwell, there is no difference between prince
and peasant.”</p>

<p>“What! Did not your title and regal attire secure
you a seat of honor?”</p>

<p>“Ah! no. Purple robes and jeweled crowns
are no passport to honor here. The robe of
Christ’s righteousness is the only garment that
admits one into the presence of the pure.”</p>

<p>“But is the robe of righteousness you speak of
a sure guarantee of Divine favor?”</p>

<p>“Never yet has it failed. In your world, a man
may live in poverty and die in distress; yet, when
he comes into this world with that spotless garment
on, all the fiends of hell shrink back in
horror at his approach, and all the angels of
Heaven greet him with shouts of joy and anthems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
of praise. The Master places a crown of gold on
his brow, and silver slippers on his feet.”</p>

<p>“But I see you have great riches in your coffin
with you; could you not bribe the doorkeeper,
and buy your way in?”</p>

<p>“Your questions mock me. What were my
paltry sum to Him who holds the world in His
hands. My advice to you is to seek first the
kingdom of God and His righteousness; to seek
peace and pursue it; to buy the truth and sell it
not. These will be worth more to you than wealth
and titles of honor and power and dominion all
combined. I would rather be a true disciple of
the Lord Jesus Christ than wear the brightest diadem
that ever graced a monarch’s brow, and know
Him not.”</p>

<p>Thanking the king for his kindness, and his
words of wisdom, I bow myself out of his presence.
The people here talk of “King So Karimsap” as
though he had lived yesterday, when the truth is
his light of life went out more than fifty centuries
before we were born! It is said that “the railroads
in Egypt use mummies for fuel; and on wet
days the engineers are heard frequently to cry
out?: ‘These plebeians won’t burn worth a cent;
hand me out a king!’ On express trains, it is
claimed, they use nothing but kings.”</p>

<p>Christmas morning I am up before the lamps
of night are dimmed by the rising god of day.
There seems to be a rivalry among the stella host,
each trying to outshine its neighbor. Each star<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
twinkles and smiles and laughs and pours a flood
of glory down. I never saw anything like it&mdash;there
is less of earth than of Heaven in the scene.
I say “Surely, these are creatures singing the
praise of their Master&mdash;of Him whose birthday
they fain would celebrate.” While yet these balls
of fire gleam bright from the blue sky above,
Johnson and I are in the saddle on our way to
the Pyramids. Yes, in the saddle. In Cairo,
saddles are street-cars. Egyptian boys, each with
a fresh-barbered donkey, bridled and saddled,
throng the streets. The moment a traveler steps
on the sidewalk, he is doomed. These boys leading
their donkeys, crowd around him like hungry
wolves around a helpless lamb. He can not get
away. The boys are irresistible. They take
hold of you, and throw you into the saddle, and
instantly the donkey moves off. Then all the
boys throw up their caps and halloo, except the
one whose donkey you are on. He, of course,
follows you, one hand grasping the donkey’s tail
and the other clutching a stick. The tail is used
as a rudder to guide the animal, and the stick as
an argument to persuade him to quicken his already
flying steps. Every one rides as if he were
carrying the mail. Indeed, he can not help it.
The donkey is running for life&mdash;he must move, or
be brained on the spot. All persons give way for
the coming donkey as if he were a steam engine.</p>

<p>Christmas Eve was our first experience. We
had gotten here the night before. I had heard of
the donkey boys, but had forgotten all about
them. Well, as soon as we stepped on the streets,
“they came, they saw, they conquered!” They
capture Johnson first. In five minutes, they had
him on a zebra-looking ass, and were rushing him
down Palm Avenue at a two-forty pace. I was
bringing up the rear, but the zebra was all
the time gaining on me. I would, probably, soon
have been left far behind, if things had moved
on smoothly. But Johnson’s “flying Dutchman”
fell&mdash;he spilt his rider on one side of the street,
and he took the other. When I rode up, the boy
was trying to bring the donkey to by twisting his
tail. Johnson was on his knees&mdash;not at prayer&mdash;and
his hat was gone. In five minutes more,
we were on our way again. We reached the
American Consul’s office in due time, and without
any broken bones. On our way back, “Yankee
Doodle” stumbled, and I fell straddle of his neck;
but on he rushed, faster than before. In vain I
struggled to get back to the saddle. All other
efforts having failed, I, in order to regain my
position, placed my feet on the embankments
rising up on either side of the rock-hewn path.
With my feet upon these embankments, I lifted
myself up for a moment, expecting at the right
time to sit down in the saddle. But the donkey
was too quick for me; when I sat down on him
he was not there. A moment later found my
head in the ditch, and my heels in the air. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
called at the drug store, and got some salve&mdash;Johnson
is better now.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc">THE PYRAMID AND SPHYNX.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Well, as I was going on to say, we get an early
start to the Pyramids. We meet hundreds of
camels coming off of the great desert, and donkeys
without number going into market, laden with hay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
and clover, fish, fuel and vegetables. Where we cross
the Nile, both banks are lined with tall, majestic
palm trees, the finest I have ever seen. The rising
sun throws the palm shadows on the river’s
broad bosom. The shadows sink into the blue
depths below; we see two palm groves standing
end to end&mdash;one above, and one below the water.</p>

<p>Now, leaving the Nile, and turning directly
west, we travel along a road that was constructed
a few years ago by the Khedive for the use of the
Prince of Wales and party. Unfortunately, I
am not informed whether the Prince made this
trip on a donkey or not. I know this, however,
whether he walked, rode an ass, or was driven in
a carriage of state, he enjoyed the Pyramids not
one whit more than I do. I can not help enjoying
them. They are already looming up before
me, clearly outlined against the sky. At first,
they seem to swim in a sea of mirage that rises
up from the surrounding country&mdash;they are composed
of such stuff as dreams are made of. But,
as I come nearer, that airy nothingness assumes
definite shape, and takes on colossal proportions.
At last I stand face to face with a Miracle in
Stone, the only remaining one of the seven wonders
of the ancient world. It is at once the most
massive and mysterious, the most towering and
majestic, the oldest, and yet the most enduring, of
all the works of man. It bursts upon me, at once,
in all the “flower of its highest perfection.” I go
“back down the stream of time,” and breathe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
atmosphere of five thousand years ago. I see,
in my imagination, thousands and thousands of
human slaves, deep down in the bowels of some
far off mountain, blasting these stones. I see
them piling the stones upon rough barges, and
floating them a thousand miles down yonder Nile.
I see them out here on the desert, clearing away a
thirteen-acre base, on which to erect a hand-made
mountain. On this thirteen-acre foundation, I
see the Pyramid rise, block after block, course
upon course, up, and still up, it goes. These
blocks of rock, one of which it takes on an average
two hundred men to raise the eighth of an
inch from the ground, are lifted high up in the air
and swung into their destined places with an exactness
that varies not the fraction of an inch.
Yes, here is the Pyramid, with its broad base,
sloping sides, and cloud-piercing summit; but who
were its builders? and where are they? Echo
answers, “who? where?”</p>

<p>“Forty centuries look down upon us from the
Pyramids,” and speak to us in trumpet tones of the
folly of human ambition. Think of the straining,
the suffering and the sorrowing, that those foolish
Pyramid-builders caused, in order to have their
bodies preserved, and their memories perpetuated.
Their work still stands, but long ago their very
bones have been ground into powder, and even
their names are unknown to man.</p>

<p>The Great Pyramid is 730 feet square at the
base, and is 460 feet high. “The usual process in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
Egyptian Pyramid building seems to have been
to start with an upright column, or needle, of
rock, and enclose it in a series of steps formed of
huge blocks of stone. Fresh series of steps were
added to the outside, till the requisite dimensions
were obtained. Then the steps were filled up
with smooth polished stones, covered with sculpture
and inscriptions.” Deep down in the Pyramids
were left open chambers and passages, as
the burial places of the illustrious builder and his
family. Of course, these interior chambers were
closed and hermetically sealed. From the Great
Pyramid, or the Pyramid of Cheops, the outer
polished stones have been removed, so now there
remains a series of colossal steps, up which some
visitors climb to the top.</p>

<p>To ascend the Pyramid, one must pay a fee to
the Sheik, who furnishes him with two strong
Arabs&mdash;some travelers require four&mdash;to assist him
up. It would be both difficult and dangerous to
attempt the ascent alone. The steps are often
five feet high. There is no chance to catch a
hand hold, and you have only twelve, and sometimes
six, inches to stand on while you struggle
to get up. We had two assistants each, yet
Johnson came very near falling. I was amused,
and excited, too, when I heard him cry out to the
Arabs, “Hold me! <i>hold me!</i>”</p>

<p>At the top of the Pyramid, there is a level platform,
about thirty feet square, from which one
gets a fine view of the surrounding country. Looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
eastward, I can trace the majestic Nile, in its
onward sweep toward the ocean, and its fertile
valley, once the granary of the world. Turning
toward the setting sun, I look out for miles and
miles over the arid desert. Not a living thing do
I see, but a caravan of camels, those ships of the
desert, just starting out on their long journey.
After descending almost to the ground, we have
then to slide on our stomachs up an inclined
plane, on the inside of the Pyramid in order to
reach the interior chamber, which was long ago
robbed of its mummied kings.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards from the Pyramid of
Cheops stands the colossal Sphynx, which, if possible,
is a greater wonder than the Pyramid itself.
The Sphynx is a huge lion with a human head.
It is therefore an emblematic sovereign, combining
the greatest earthly wisdom with the greatest
possible strength. I said the Sphynx is colossal.
Look at it and see for yourself. Its paws are fifty
feet, and its body one hundred and forty feet in
length. Its massive head is of proportionate size.
This image is hewn out of solid stone, and stands
out before us in giant-like proportions. And yet
it is so graceful and symmetrical, withal, that we
half-way forget its size. We are wondering why
it does not move and walk, why we can not see it
breathe and roll its eyes. If God would only
touch the Sphynx, it would instantly become a
living creature! Its countenance has been described
as wearing “an expression of the softest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
beauty and most winning grace.” This, however,
must have been in the days of its youth. At
present, it has a furrowed brow and wrinkled.
Its eyes are deep back in its head, and its jaws are
firmly set. It wears a pensive, thoughtful look.</p>

<p>I speak to the Sphynx, but, paying no attention,
it stands “staring right on, with calm eternal eyes.”
As an old man in his dotage, forgets all that took
place during the days of his strength and manly
glory, and thinks only of those things which
occurred in early life, so this Sphynx stands, with
memory stretching like rainbow from old age to
childhood. It is thinking about the confusion of
tongues that took place around the tower of
Babel; about the morning when the city of Damascus
was laid out by Uz, the great-grandson of
Noah; about the day when God appeared to
Abraham, and told him to leave the land of Ur
and go into the land of Canaan. It is thinking
about the time when Joseph ruled Egypt; when
Moses was found in the ark of bulrushes, on the
bosom of yonder Nile; when Pharaoh was swallowed
up by the Red Sea. In middle life, this
“eternal statue” saw Troy fall and Athens rise.
In old age, it saw Rome flourish, fade and fall.</p>

<p>Standing side by side, are the Sphynx and the
Pyramids, both huge in dimensions, both graceful
in appearance, both impressive to behold, both
“ancient as the sun,” and both I believe, will be
among the last earthly objects to yield to the
“wasting tooth of Time.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">FOR some months past I have been breathing
the atmosphere of Asia and Africa. While
there I was completely shut out from civilization.
I have not received a paper or the scratch
of a pen from any one in many weeks. I must
have a letter soon, if I have to write it myself.</p>

<p>Since leaving Egypt I have been four days on
the Mediterranean&mdash;I had almost said “four days
in Gehenna.” I flattered myself that I was a
moderately good sailor, but this time I lost my
sea legs in half an hour after going on board the
steamer, nor did I discover their whereabouts
until twelve hours after landing. I thought of
Paul’s experience when making a similar voyage.
In Acts 27:6 we are told that Paul was put in a
ship “sailing from Alexandria to Italy.” So was
I. Paul’s vessel was struck with a “tempestuous
wind, called Euroclydon,” and was “exceedingly
tossed with a tempest.” So was mine. Paul sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
close by the islands of Crete and Clauda. So
did I. I was sea-sick&mdash;so was Paul, I suppose.
Indeed it was a voyage long to be remembered.
I am a splendid sailor&mdash;on land&mdash;but I can not
navigate a “tempestuous sea.”</p>

<p>Europe again! I feel as one who has been
keeping company with the dead, and has now
been raised from the grave and brought back to
the land of the living. Verily, the people of Asia
and Africa are dead&mdash;dead spiritually, dead in
trespasses and sin, dead to literature and learning,
dead to the progress the world is making. Not
only dead, but buried&mdash;buried in conceit, in selfishness,
in filth and ignorance. Yes, these people
are dead and buried in a sepulchre, and against
the door of that sepulchre Poverty has placed a
stone which naught but the angels of God can
remove. Come, O winged angel, come quickly.
Roll away this stone, that these benighted people
may be raised up to the nineteenth century and
to God!</p>

<p>I am now on Italian soil in Naples, under a
soft Italian sky, and God’s bright and cheerful
sunshine, streaming through my window, is falling
in golden ringlets upon the floor. Naples boasts
1,000,000 inhabitants, and possesses many charms
for the traveler. In approaching the city from
the bay the scene is peculiarly striking. It was
perhaps this charming picture that gave rise to
the saying: “See Naples and die.”</p>

</div></div>

<p>A fine day this to visit Pompeii, which is only
fifteen miles away. It is situated on a narrow
table-land which on one side slopes gently down
to the bay, and on the other side rises up steeply
to the crest of Mt. Vesuvius. We go by
train. In half an hour after leaving Naples, we
hear the conductor shouting: “Pompeii! Pompeii!!”
Fifteen minutes later we are standing before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
“Porta della Marina,” knocking for entrance.</p>

<p>While waiting for the keeper to open the gate,
let me relate as briefly as possible the history of
this “City of the Dead,” as Sir Walter Scott calls
Pompeii. This city (pro. Pom-<i>pay</i>-ee) was in a
flourishing condition hundreds of years before the
Christian era. It was founded by the Oscans,
but soon fell under Greek influence and civilization.
The Greeks, in turn, were subdued by the
strong hand of the Caesars and Pompeii became
a Roman town.</p>

<p>In A. D. 63, there came an earthquake and a
slight eruption of Vesuvius, which together destroyed
the greater part of the city. As soon,
however, as the earth ceased to tremble, and the
mountain to smoke, the work of re-construction
began. As in Chicago, after the great fire, the
debris was removed, the city was enlarged, the
streets were laid out with greater care and more
regularity than before. Streams of gold now
flowed in from every direction. The magician
waved his wand, and lo! from the wreck and ruin
of the past, there rose a city of palatial residences
and marble temples. Art flourished. Every wall
was pictured, every niche held a statue, every
column was wreathed with a garland of sculptured
roses. Fountains played, monuments arose in
honor of Augustus and Nero, triumphal arches
were flung across the principal entrances to the
city, the marble forms of mythological gods filled
the public squares and stood at every street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
corner. On the fifteenth page of “The Last Days
of Pompeii” the author says: “Pompeii was the
miniature of the civilization of that age. Within
the narrow compass of its walks was contained, as
it were, a specimen of every gift which Luxury
offered to Power. In its minute but glittering
shops, its tiny palaces, its baths, its forum, its
theater, its circus, in the energy yet corruption, in
the refinement yet the vice of its people, you beheld
a model of the whole empire. It was a toy,
a play thing, a show-box, in which the gods seemed
pleased to keep the representation of the great
monarchy of Earth, and which they afterward hid
from Time to give to the wonder of Posterity!”</p>

<p>This “miniature city,” rising from the midst of
a luxuriant vineyard, stood on a beautiful table
land and was girt around with a strong wall.
Back behind the city, and close at hand, rose the
awful form of that sleeping volcano. The ambitious
vine had climbed up and spread its fruitful
branches over the crater itself. Purple clusters
of luscious fruit silently slept in the sunshine,
high aloft on the mountain side. Just below the
city, in front and to the south, was the glassy Bay
of Naples covered with vessels of commerce, and
gilded galleys of the rich. All in all, Pompeii and
its surroundings formed one of the most pleasing
pictures that ever greeted the human eye.</p>

<p>Pompeii had just reached its boasted perfection
when, on the 24th of August, A. D. 79, fifty years
after the Crucifixion, it was destroyed by Vesuvius.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
Pliny, whose mother was among those buried
alive, wrote two letters to his friend, the historian
Tacitus, in which letters he gives a graphic description
of this fearful scene. He speaks of “the
premonitory earthquakes, day turned into night
the extraordinary agitation of the sea, the dense
clouds overhanging the land and sea, and riven
by incessant flashes of lightning, the emission of
fire and ashes, the descent of streams of lava, and
the universal terror of men, who believed the end
of the world had arrived.” At the time of the
eruption many of the houses were closed; hence
they were not filled, but simply surrounded by
and covered with ashes. This of course excluded
all air. Thus many houses were hermetically
sealed, as was also the city itself. Of the 30,000
souls dwelling in Pompeii, 2,000 or more perished
with the city. Pompeii, being built entirely of
stone, marble and granite did not burn, but was
simply buried beneath this incumbent mass. For
1,700 years it was wrapped in ashes and hid from
the face of the earth. For centuries its very site
was unknown, and even its name forgotten. “But
earth, with faithful watch, has hoarded all,” and
during the last few years much of the buried city
has been unearthed and brought to light.</p>

<p>What a rich field for excavation! It has proved
an inexhaustible store-house of wealth, and a
perfect treasury of art. Great quantities of gold
and silver coins and jewelry, frescoes, pictures,
statuary, household furniture, and cooking utensils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
have been found; also several large loaves of
bread in a perfect state of preservation, and jars
of pickled olives. How strange to have one’s
appetite tempted by articles of food that were
prepared for those who lived 1,700 years ago!</p>

<p>Many dogs and horses, and not less than three
to four hundred human bodies, have been discovered.
Eighteen bodies were in one room. You
see to-day the contortions their bodies were in,
and the expression their countenances wore, at the
moment of death. Their tangled and disheveled
hair is clotted with ashes. In the excitement and
confusion of that awful hour, the terror-stricken
inhabitants of the doomed city ran to and fro
through the streets, calling upon their gods for
safety and deliverance. They were over-powered
by the falling shower of ashes and cinders. They
threw themselves upon the ground, their faces
upon their arms. At this moment, the sluggish
stream of wet ashes which poured forth from
Vesuvius passed over them. Many no doubt
welcomed death. For seventeen centuries their
quiet slumbers were undisturbed.</p>

<p>One man was found with ten pieces of gold in
one hand, and a large key in the other. Gold,
however, was no bribe to the fiery fiend. But for
that gold, the owner might have escaped; but no,
he must return to get it. He would not leave it.
Hence he did not leave at all. I know many men
who are acting as foolishly to-day, as this citizen
of Pompeii did ages ago. Many a man says: “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
will make my fortune; I will get my gold first, and
then look to my soul’s welfare.” O reader, the
day of judgment is at hand! “Flee from the
wrath to come;” “flee for thy life.” “Seek first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness,” and
then get your gold.</p>

<p>Some of these bodies are adorned now as on
the day of death, with rings and bracelets and
necklaces.</p>

<p>The most poetical thing, perhaps, that Pompeii
has yielded to modern research is two bodies, male
and female, who died in each other’s arms. Let
us imagine these persons in the spring-time of
life, with the dew of youth still fresh upon their
brows; that the girl was beautiful and accomplished,
the man strong and true and brave; that
their hearts had been touched by Love’s magic
wand, and made one; that when on that August
day darkness came, when the earth shook, and
the volcano poured forth molten streams of fire
and consternation, he could have escaped, but he
would not go without her. He sought her and
she sought him. But when they found each other
she was weak and exhausted and could go no
farther. She said: “Go, loved one; go save, save
thyself!” He replied: “Leave thee, never! Let
the thunder roar and the lightnings flash; let the
earth reel and the mountains pour forth their
fiery streams of death; I die with you rather than
live without you!” So saying, they embraced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
each other and perished. That embrace is still
unbroken.</p>

<p>As I gaze upon the bodies of these faithful
lovers, I fancy, for the time, that I am a poet with
the harp of Apollo in my hand. Heavenly breezes
sweep across the strings of that golden lyre, and
wake for me a song which, for pathos and sweetness,
rivals the minstrelsy of angels.</p>

<p>At present Pompeii is protected by the same
wall that surrounded it when Christ was born in
Bethlehem. The city is laid bare. Every thing
is clean and neat. The streets are narrow, but
straight and well paved with broad flags of lava.
These stone-like pavements are worn in some
places eight or ten inches deep by the chariot
wheels that used to thunder along these busy
streets.</p>

<p>All houses of Pompeii are now roofless, though
otherwise most of them are perfectly preserved.
They are usually one story high. The walls
were, and are still, covered with beautiful frescoes.
Mythology was a favorite subject for the painter&mdash;everywhere
we see pictures of Minerva, Apollo,
Jupiter, Bacchus, and Hercules performing his
twelve labors. The floors, clean as any parlor,
are inlaid with rich mosaics, representing historical
events, gladitorial contests, etc.</p>

<p>As one walks the streets of Pompeii on a
moonlight night, the ghost of the past rises up
before him. He has read in history about the
luxury, pomp, and splendor of ancient Rome, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
here he sees a Roman city as it was in the golden
days of Nero. One who has a vivid imagination,
can stand here at night and easily people these
palaces, streets, and theatres with the pleasure-loving
Romans of 2,000 years ago. Ah, how
they thronged these streets! How eagerly they
crowded into the amphitheatre to see the gladiators
measure swords with each other; to see
men pitted against ferocious lions and tigers,
against wild bulls and boars!</p>

<p>When their city was finished and the wall
around it completed, the Pompeiians decided that
they needed a protector. Finally the honor was
accorded to Minerva. Accordingly a huge and
magnificent marble statue of this Goddess was
prepared and erected near Porta della Marina&mdash;the
Marine Gate&mdash;the principal entrance to the
city. This faultless statue was itself about twelve
feet high, and stood upon a pedestal of equal
altitude. In her left hand the Goddess held a
shield, her right grasped a spear, while her brow
was graced with the victor’s wreath. The appointed
day came. The people assembled around
the statue, while the best orators of Rome and
the world pronounced glowing eulogies upon the
new city and the wise Goddess. Thus Pompeii
was dedicated and formally turned over to Minerva
for her protection. And protect it she did
as long as it needed no protection. But wait until
that fatal night. The protector was then insensible
to the trembling earth, deaf to the pealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
thunder, blind to the flashing lightning that
wreathed her brow. She heard not the cries of
her terror-stricken people. She raised not her
shield nor lifted her spear to stay the calamity.
The heavens darkened, the ocean heaved, the
mountain reeled, cataracts of fire came leaping
down the steeps and rolling on towards the city.
Yet there stood Minerva blind, dumb, mute, and
motionless, able to protect neither herself nor
the city!</p>

<p>If the Pompeiians had dedicated their city to
the Great I Am, who “guides His people with His
eye,” and whose “ear is ever open to their cries,”
its history might have been different. Now reader,
allow the author to suggest that you dedicate
your life, not to the blind goddess of wealth or of
fashion, but to that God who is “a very present
help in every time of need”&mdash;to that God who
delivered Peter from prison, and rescued Daniel
from the lion’s den.</p>

<p class="drop-capi08">ITALY, as the reader will remember, is in the
shape of a boot, and you find Mt. Vesuvius
on the instep of that boot.</p>

<p>Leaving Naples by train we skirt along the
beautiful bay by the same name and step off,
as in the last chapter, at Pompeii, some fifteen
miles from the starting point. Mt. Vesuvius now
lifts its majestic form before us, and I am sure
that if we should live to be as old as Methuselah,
we can never forget its awful, yet picturesque and
beautiful appearance.</p>

<p>Take if you please a deep soup plate and turn
it bottom upwards on your table. Next get a
tea-cup and turn that bottom upwards on the
center of the plate. Now imagine the table to
be a broad, fertile field covered with vines. Imagine
the plate to be fifteen miles in circumference,
and that it swells from the plain and lifts itself
up until the cup, rising sharp-pointed like a huge
pyramid, reaches to the height of 4,200 feet. This
is Mt. Vesuvius, and you must know that it is as
black as charcoal and rough as a tree that has
been a thousand times struck by lightning. It is
hollow like a cup and is open at the top as the
inverted cup would be if the bottom were out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>
<p>As I stand gazing at Vesuvius, it is slowly
emitting a huge volume of white, sulphurous
smoke or steam which rises straight like a
mighty shaft of marble for a thousand feet above
the crater, then gracefully curving, the column
stretches itself across the glassy bay of Naples
for ten miles or more until finally it joins itself
with the fleecy clouds. What a picture it presents!
There is the great city throbbing with
life; the silvery bay flecked with white-winged and
smoke-plumed vessels; there is the broad, fertile
plain, covered with fruit-bearing vineyards, and
dotted here and there with small, rude and dilapidated
peasant villages; there are the black mountain
and the white column of steam, clearly outlined
against the rich blue, Italian sky. Such a
scene, I am sure, could not fail to wake a song
from the poet, or inspire the artist to put forth
his best endeavors.</p>

<p>There are about 650 volcanoes in existence, but
Dr. Hartwig says, “For the naturalist’s researches,
for the traveler’s curiosity and the poet’s song,
Etna and Vesuvius surpass in renown all other
volcanic regions in the world.” Knowing that
Vesuvius is so noted, I am anxious to observe the
phenomena closely, and to do this I must cross
the plain and ascend the mountain. We can not
go alone and it is too far to walk. Securing our
horses and a guide, we set out on the journey.</p>

<p>Johnson’s horse is named Maccaroni; mine has
no name; he had one once, but has long ago
worn it out. I am at a loss to know what to
name him. I can not conscientiously call him
Baalbek, for he is not a “magnificent” ruin. But
I can with perfect propriety, and without a sacrifice
of principle, call him Pompeii, “an ancient
ruin.” He looks as if he might have been in the
doomed city on that fatal day, and as if he has
not yet recovered from the ill effects of that day’s
experience. His teeth are out, his mane is gone,
he has no tail. His backbone is so much in the
shape of a razor blade, that it has split the saddle
wide open, fore and aft. The two parts are
roped together, and carelessly thrown across the
skeleton. This protects me somewhat, and I
would be moderately comfortable if the saddle did
not hang too far to the starboard side. Albeit I
have great respect for that horse&mdash;his age demands
it. No horse can go higher than the foot
of the cone&mdash;the cup. Here dismounting, I am
at once accosted by a swarm of Italians who
want to assist me up the cone. It takes four of
these swarthy athletes to carry one pilgrim up.
They put him in a “portantina,” a kind of chair
made for the purpose. The four men, taking this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
chair on their shoulders, begin the ascent, stopping
quite frequently to rest. Other assistants
have straps or ropes, which they put around the
pilgrim just below the arms; then two men, each
holding one end of the rope, walk in front and
thus draw their victim up. Many Italians earn a
livelihood in this way. I do not avail myself of
their proffered help&mdash;I can not bear to impose on
good nature.</p>

<p>Yes, I go alone, but I frankly confess it is hard
work. The ascent is very steep. In my schoolboy
days I climbed many trees, tall, smooth
bodied and limbless, after young squirrels, grapes
and chestnuts. Since then I have climbed many
mountains. I have climbed the Rocky Mountains.
I have climbed mountains in Mexico, in
Virginia, West Virginia, Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Canada. I have climbed mountains
in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales; in Germany
and France, in Switzerland and Italy, in
Austria and Hungary, in Servia and Roumania,
in Bulgaria and Slavonia, in Greece, Russia and
Asia Minor, in Palestine, Syria and Arabia. I
have climbed the Pyramids of Egypt. But I have
never climbed anything that wearied me as does
the ascent of Vesuvius. It is like climbing a
mountain of shot. I sink at each step half leg
deep in charcoal and ashes. I frequently stumble
and fall. It is uphill business. I am walking on
snow and sniffing the mountain breeze, yet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
perspiration rolls off of me like rain&mdash;a light
shower of course.</p>

<p>By this time we come to where the footing is
more firm and solid, but the way not less trying
and difficult. There are many narrow and yawning
crevices to cross, many deep openings to shun
on the right and left&mdash;some of them large enough
to swallow a good-sized house. Perchance it was
one of these dark caverns wherein dwelt that lazy
hag, with a fox and a slimy serpent as her sole
companions&mdash;I mean that weird witch who cursed
Glaucus and Ione and helped Arbaces, the
Egyptian, to work out his diabolical purposes.
This part of the cone is composed of black and
hardened lava, hideously rough and jagged, porous
as honeycomb. Here and there small jets of
smoke and hot steam, some of them no larger
than my thumb, others as large as my arm, or
twice as large, can be seen spouting from the
crevices and openings. We frequently stop and
warm our feet at these “flues,” but the flames are
so strongly impregnated with sulphur that we can
not stand it long at a time. We are now within
two hundred yards of the top. It looks dangerous
to go farther, but our guide says we have
only to follow him, and follow him we do. After
scaling with great difficulty and some danger the
steep and rocky sides, we reach the crater’s brink
and look down into Vulcan’s Forge, into that
deep and awful abyss from which clouds of sulphurous
vapors are rising as from the gates of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
perdition. A strong wind blowing from the north
drives the smoke and steam in the opposite direction.
This enables us to see better and induces
us to venture too near the edge. All at once the
wind changes and suddenly we are enveloped in
dense fumes of sulphur. To retreat in the dark
is perilous&mdash;to remain long in this sulphur is
death. I swallow some of the steam which is
so strong with sulphur that it instantly scalds my
throat and lungs. What can be done! Johnson
and I have hold of each other’s hands. I fall to
the ground pulling him with me. Thus by keeping
our mouths close to the ground, we manage
to get fresh air enough to keep from being suffocated.
When the wind shifts and the smoke lifts,
we lose no time in changing to a less dangerous
place. Some time ago a German was unfortunate
enough to fall into this fearful chasm. What an
awful death! How thankful I am for God’s preserving
care!</p>

<p>By this time night has come, and as we stand in
darkness, looking down into this fearful abyss,
we can see the lurid flames writhing and leaping,
casting up great quantities of glowing brimstone
and red-hot lava hundreds of feet into the air.
The next moment the lava is falling around us in
showers of living fire. The pieces are of all
shapes and vary greatly in size. While some of
them are no larger than a marble, others are
large as a saucer&mdash;perchance as large as a plate.</p>

<p>Deep down below us we hear the boiling caldrons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
of lava grinding, gurgling, growling. Now
we hear the report of big guns and little guns, of
musketry and of cannon, as if the damned are
bombarding each other with the artillery of hell!
Report chases report through the subterranean
caverns like deep thunder galloping after thunder.
The angry flames continue to leap and crackle.
Occasionally the whole crater, which looks like
the veritable mouth of hell, glows with intense
brilliancy and glitters and sparkles with ten thousand
points of dazzling light. The volume of
steam, or “the mighty column of wreaths and
curling heaps of lighted vapor,” continue to pour
forth with frightful rapidity. Every moment
witnesses a new upheaval of red-hot lava and
consequently a fresh shower of fire.</p>

<p>The guide now informs me (I did not know it
before) that the night is far spent, and yet there
are other things to see. Going round on the
northeast side of the mountain and descending a
few hundred yards from the top, we come to a
stream of red-hot lava&mdash;an actual river of fire&mdash;bursting
forth from the mountain side and flowing
down into the valley. It looks like a stream of
melted iron slowly winding its way adown the
blackened mountain-side, bearing upon its heated
bosom great quantities of glowing brimstone and
red-hot rocks. Ever and anon the rocks in the
stream dash against each other with such force as
to break themselves to pieces, then follow a slight
explosion and blaze. The angry flames like fiery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
fiends leap into the air and vanish. As one
stands enveloped in the blackness of the night,
contemplating this wonderful phenomenon&mdash;these
flames, suddenly bursting and vanishing, chasing
each other in quick succession, look like the
incessant flashes of lurid lightning! Flame rises
after flame, vanishing away in the darkness like
winged devils chasing each other! I am filled
with admiration, and at the same time struck with
awe and chilled with fear. I do not know at what
moment the whole volcano may boil over and
pour forth a thousand cataracts of fire, as in 1872.
I feel that I want to go, that I must go, yet I can
not leave. I go a few paces and stop, looking
first at the glowing column above me, then at the
winding, fiery stream below.</p>

<p>I have seen many mountains, some of them
rising to heaven, covered with snow, and at night
crowned with stars; but never before have I seen
one smoke-plumed and wreathed with flame, one
belching forth fire and brimstone, one whose
iron-belted sides poured forth a river of fire&mdash;a
moving flood of flame. But why continue?
Why describe the indescribable? For, reader, I
assure you that unless I, like Vesuvius, had a tongue
of fire and a voice of thunder, unless words were
gems that would flame and flash with many-colored
light upon the canvas and throw thence a
tremulous glimmer into the beholder’s eyes, it
were vain indeed to attempt a description of
God’s imperial fireworks.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">CAESER and Cicero, Horace and Hadrian
Claudius and Cataline, have all passed away,
but “the mother of empires” is still enthroned
upon her seven hill. “Still enthroned?” Yes,
but her regal brow is no longer crowned with
glory. From her right hand has fallen that golden
scepter which once ruled the world, and from her
left, the palm branch of victory which she once
proudly waved on high. The luster has faded
from her eyes. She sits to-day upon her seven
hills, not as a queen, but as a mourner. She is as
a widow in her weeds, as a mother broken-hearted
and sad. Like Rachel of old she weeps for her
children, she weeps and will not be comforted, for
they are not.</p>

<p>No, “they are not.” In vain the traveler
searches for Julius Caesar and Augustus. He
finds where the one fell at the base of Pompey’s
statue, and where the ashes of the other were laid
to rest in that splendid mausoleum. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
more. Only enough of that precious metal was
rescued from “Nero’s golden palace” to gild one
page of history; that is all.</p>

<p>Modern Rome, compared with the imperial city,
is nothing but a confused mass of “ruined greatness”
thrown into the deep, dark chasm lying
between the past and the present. “If we consider
the present city as at all connected with the
famous one of old,” says Hawthorne, “it is only
because it is built over its grave.” Imperial Rome
was a corpse that no survivor was mighty enough
to bury. But Time&mdash;“Time the tomb-builder”&mdash;did
not despair. Age after age passed by, each
shaking the dust of his feet upon the ruined city,
until now the “Rome of ancient days” is thirty
feet below surface. Time silently boasts of his
triumphs, but the day is coming when even Time
himself will be swallowed up by eternity!</p>

<p>Gibbon can tell you more about ancient Rome
than I can. I shall therefore deal with the past
only in so far as “the very dust of Rome is historic,”
and that dust inevitably settles down upon
my page and mixes with my ink.</p>

<p>Until seventeen years ago Rome was an independent
city; it belonged to no government
and formed a part of no country; it was “Papal
Rome.” In other words, it wholly belonged to,
and was entirely controlled by, the Pope of
Rome&mdash;the spiritual head&mdash;I had almost said the
“spiritless head”&mdash;of the Catholic church. Thirty
thousand French soldiers were stationed in Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
to protect the Pope and defend the city. When,
in 1870, the Franco-German war broke out Napoleon
the Third was compelled to recall his troops
from Rome, that they might join the army against
Germany. As soon as the French withdrew, Victor
Emmanuel, King of Italy, marched an army
against the Papal city, saying, “Again, I swear the
Eternal City shall be free!”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>Resistance was of short duration. The national
flag was soon unfurled from the dome of the
Pantheon and from that day Rome has been the
home of the king, the capital of United Italy.
The Rome of that period (1870) was described
as a city of “sunless alleys,” and “a thousand evil
smells mixed up with fragrance of rich incense,
diffused from as many censers; everywhere a
cross, and nastiness at the foot of it.” “The city
is filled,” the writer continues, “with a gloom and
languor that depress it beyond any depth of melancholic
sentiment that can elsewhere be known.”
One-seventh of the city was occupied by convents
and monasteries. Rome at that time had a population
of 216,000 souls, more than half of whom
could neither read nor write! This, then, is
Catholicism&mdash;ignorance clothed in rags, living in
poverty, walking in filth, praying to saints and
bowing to an ambitious Pope! If this be religion,
the less I have of it the more I congratulate myself.
For centuries the city belonged to the
church, and it is natural to suppose that Popery
created for itself an atmosphere that was most
congenial to its own spirit. Ignorance is the
handmaid of Popery. Indeed, a man to be a good
Catholic must be ignorant. He may, perchance,
be legally learned, he may be thoroughly versed
in the laws of logic and language; but to be a
devout Romanist he must at least be ignorant of
the Bible. As civilization advances, as the light
of God’s truth becomes more widely diffused and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
the warmth of His Spirit more generally felt,
darkness will flee away, truth will be revealed in
its purity, and Christ, Christ the Lord, will be
elevated to the position which the Papal world of
to-day assigns to Peter.</p>

<p>Great changes have been wrought in Rome
within the last seventeen years. A number of the
streets have been broadened and straightened
and others are being worked on. Most of them
now, though still narrow, are well paved and
clean. The population has increased to 350,000,
sixty schools have been established with 550
teachers and 25,000 pupils. Most of the improvements
and inventions of the age have been introduced
into the city, a healthy trade with the
outside world has been established, and last, and
greatest, the gospel of Christ has again been
brought to these people. The populace welcome
these changes.</p>

<p>Victor Emmanuel, who died ten years ago, is
called the father of his country; and his son, the
present king, is the idol of Italy. The Pope and
the king are at enmity. Each is jealous of the
other. The king is fast gaining favor. Papacy
must go.</p>

<p>Now, turning from the moral, I must tell you
something about the physical appearance of the
city at present. Of course every one knows that
Rome is situated on seven hills, that it is divided
into two parts by the river Tiber and that it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
surrounded by a massive wall thirty feet high and
sixteen miles long.</p>

<p>Let us now go into the midst of the city and
take our stand on the Capitoline Hill. From
there we can easily “view the landscape o’er.”
Beneath us, as we stand on this elevation, the
city spreads wide away in all directions. We
look out over a sea of red-tile roofs, above which
rise hundreds of imposing palaces, of tall and
stately mansions. Of church spires and cathedral
towers there is no end. Yonder to the south is
the Mausoleum of Augustus, a huge circular building
with a low, flat dome of glass. After death
the emperor was burnt. His ashes, which were
here laid to rest, have long since been scattered
to the four winds of heaven and the mausoleum
is now used as a theatre. There, too, in the same
direction, but beyond the Tiber, is the tomb of
Hadrian, looking like an old castle perched high
upon an uplifted rock. The unscrupulous Italians
of the present have no respect for the dead
of ancient days. Their desecrating hands have
turned this tomb into a military stronghold&mdash;a
citadel. What is fame? Once upon a time
Augustus ruled the world. To-day the populace
assemble in his mausoleum; there they wildly
clap their hands, and, stretching their mouths
from ear to ear, they shout aloud and grin like
apes as they see the vile actor dancing over
Caesar’s ashes. Hadrian, once adored as a God,
is no longer respected. The half-paid soldiers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
to-day have entered his very tomb; there they
fight, drink and curse and play cards. If they
could find it they would use his skull as a soup-dish
or a billiard ball, and his thigh bones they
would use for drum-sticks or as mallets to crack
nuts! “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!”</p>

<p>Turning our eyes in a northwest direction, we
see the Antonine column rising majestically above
the red roofs. In close proximity to this column,
we see the circular dome of that world-renowned
Pantheon “looking heavenward with its ever open
eye.” We leave the Capitoline Hill for a few
minutes while we go to visit the Pantheon. It
commands our respect. It was built almost a
half century before the angel host visited the
shepherds upon the plains of Bethlehem, and yet
it is as perfect to-day as though it had been finished
yesterday. It looks as if it might stand
until Gabriel comes. It is the noblest structure
that the old Romans bequeathed to posterity.
Its massive walls and solid, which are twenty feet
thick, rise to an immense height, and yet the
dome, broad as it is high, towers 140 feet above
the walls.</p>

<p>The portico (110 feet wide and 45 feet deep) is
borne by sixteen Corinthian columns of granite,
thirteen feet in circumference and forty feet high.</p>

<p>The spacious interior, lighted by a single aperture
in the centre of the dome, produces in the
beholder a most pleasing sensation. Indeed, it
is by some supposed that the beautiful effect produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
upon the interior by the light streaming in
through this one opening, is what first suggested
the name of Pantheon&mdash;a resemblance to the blue
vault of heaven. But of course the current belief
is that the purpose for which the building was
used determined its name&mdash;<i>Pantheon</i> (Pan, all,
and Theos, god)&mdash;a temple dedicated to all gods.
The smooth surface of the walls is broken by
seven niches, in which stood marble statues of
Roman divinities, among which may be mentioned
Mars and Venus. And after his assassination,
Caesar himself was elevated to the dignity of a
god. His statue graced one of the niches, and
was, no doubt, worshiped by the same fickle multitude
who rejoiced when the dagger drank his
blood.</p>

<p>This splendid edifice, built by the ancients, and
dedicated two thousand years ago to the worship
of heathen gods, is now used as a Christian
Church. To the left of the door as we enter is
the tomb of Raphael, the greatest of all painters.
In accordance with his will, a marble statue of
Madonna has been placed above his splendid
tomb. The following beautiful inscription shows
the high esteem Italians have for this divinely
gifted artist:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Beneath this stone rest the ashes of Raphael,</p>
<p class="pp8">the greatest of all painters.</p>
<p class="pp6">Nature, becoming jealous of him</p>
<p class="pp7">lest he should surpass her,</p>
<p class="pp6">Slew him while he was yet young.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">Victor Emmanuel, and many other men of renown,
are also buried within these time-honored
walls. Of the Pantheon Lord Byron says:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime&mdash;<br />
Shrine of all saints and temple of all gods,<br />
From Jove to Jesus&mdash;spared and blest by time;<br />
Looking tranquillity while falls and nods<br />
Arch empire each thing round thee and man plods<br />
His way through thorns to ashes&mdash;glorious dome!<br />
Shalt thou not last? Time’s scythe and tyrants’ rods<br />
Shiver upon thee&mdash;sanctuary and home<br />
Of art and piety&mdash;Pantheon!&mdash;pride of Rome!<br />
Relic of nobler days and noblest arts!<br />
Despoiled, yet perfect, with thy circle spreads<br />
A holiness appealing to all hearts&mdash;To<br />
art a model; and to him who treads<br />
Rome for the sake of ages, Glory sheds<br />
Her light through thy sole aperture; to those<br />
Who worship, here are altars for their beads;<br />
And they who feel for genius may repose<br />
Their eyes on honored forms, whose busts around the close.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi20">“WHAT are the chief features of Rome?”
was the second question asked me by
a friend whom I met yesterday. “Art
and Architecture,” was the unhesitating reply.
Indeed hesitation was unnecessary; my mind was
already made up on that point, and there can be
no question as to the correctness of the answer.</p>

<p>Nature seems to have implanted a love for Art
in the sons of Italy, and whispered its secrets to
them as to no other people. She teaches them
by object lessons. At night she embosoms the
moon in her soft blue sky like a silver crescent in
a velvet cushion, and the stars with their new
polished lustre seem to bestud God’s diamond
throne. In the morning the same azure sky is
“flecked with blushes and gattled with fire.” As
the Italian at the evening hour stands under the
sunny vine, on the green hillside, looking at the
glowing, lighted west through the molten bars of
twilight; as he sees the purple clouds, lying along
the horizon, fade from rich purple to pale blue&mdash;from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
blue to lavender&mdash;to pink&mdash;to scarlet&mdash;then
to banks of molten gold; as he beholds the imperial
splendors of the setting sun “vast mirrored
on the sea,”&mdash;he gathers inspiration&mdash;his soul
catches the fire&mdash;the whole scene is photographed
on the landscape of his memory. He there learns
how best to blend his colors, and next day as he
stands before his canvas beauty hangs upon his
brush like sparks of livid light.</p>

<p>Angelo, Raphael, and Di Vinci were pupils of
Nature. Once upon a time Socrates, after listening
to his pupils discourse on philosophy, arose
and, pointing to them, said: “What greater honor
could a teacher ask than to have such pupils as
Plato and Xenophon?” And methinks after seeing
the Final Judgment of the first, The Transfiguration
of the second, and The Last Supper of
the third, Nature herself would rise and, pointing
to them with pride, say: “What greater honor
could I, even I, ask than to have such pupils as
Angelo, Raphael, and Di Vinci!”</p>

<p>After Dante had written “The Inferno,” the
people of Florence as they saw him walking
through the streets, would shrink from him and
whisper, “<i>That is the man who was in hell</i>.” “It
were impossible,” they said, “for one to write
about the infernal world as Dante did, without
having seen it.” The same thought impresses itself
upon one as he beholds The Final Judgment.
One says, “that picture was surely painted by an
eye-witness.” Indeed you see no picture&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
see the final judgment itself. You see Christ as
judge, coming on the clouds, preceded by Gabriel
and followed by a legion of angels. You see the
assembled multitude, people from every nation,
kindred, tribe and tongue, standing in the back
ground breathless, awaiting the decision of the
Judge. You see the remorse, the anguish, the
misery, the woe of those who are led to the left
and hurled headlong into the fiery pit below!
Their expression convinces you that they realize
in their hearts that no rainbow of hope will ever
again brighten their skies, no note of mercy will
ever more peal in their ears. You see the pleasure,
the joy, the rapture, the ecstasy, that gladdens
the hearts and illuminates the faces, of those who
hear the welcome plaudit&mdash;“Well done, good and
faithful servants&mdash;enter ye into the joy of your
Lord.” After seeing this picture one can but say:
“Michael Angelo saw the final judgment, and
showed it me.”</p>

<p>Soon after this picture was begun, one of the
Cardinals of Rome, objecting to the artist’s design,
interfered with the work. Angelo refused
to make any alterations in his plan. The Cardinal
demanded a change, whereupon Angelo gave
up the engagement. The Cardinal then sent for
other celebrated artists and requested them to
finish the picture. Each and all of them declared
that the work was beyond their scope and power.
They all agreed that Michael Angelo was the
only living man who could finish so perfect a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
piece of work. The Cardinal now sent for Angelo
but he refused to have any further communication
with that prelate.</p>

<p>Finally the Pope himself interviewed the artist
on the subject and agreed that he might finish
the picture according to the first design, or according
to any other design that he might choose.
The Pope further agreed that the artist should
not be interfered with in his work, and when once
finished the picture should never be altered or
changed. With this understanding Angelo resumed,
and in due time finished, his work.</p>

<p>When the day of exhibition came, thousands of
people gathered to see the picture. When the
curtain was drawn aside the astonished multitude
recognized the Cardinal in hell. “In hell he lifted
up his eyes.” When the Cardinal saw himself
among the damned his wrath was kindled more
than a little. He went to the Pope in a rage and
asked to be rescued. The Pope replied to the
Cardinal, “If you were in purgatory I could get
you out, but you know that according to the
Catholic faith, when a man is once in hell he has
to stay there. I can do nothing for you.” So
the poor Cardinal is in hell&mdash;according to the
picture.</p>

<p>This wonderful picture sixty-four feet in
breadth covers almost the entire south end of
the world-famed Sistine Chapel. This is a private
chapel in the Vatican, the Pope’s palace.
“Sistine,” because built by Sixtus, and famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
because of the picture just mentioned, and the
frescoes on the ceiling by the same gifted artist.</p>

<p>These frescoes represent Bible scenes, large as
life, impressive as death, yet beautiful beyond
description. The artist begins at a time when
everything is “without form and void.” The first
picture represents God, with motion of his arms,
bringing law and order out of chaos and confusion.
In the second, God with outstretched
hands creates the sun and moon. We see the
creation of Adam and the formation of Eve, then
the temptation in and expulsion from Eden. Finally
we see the ark floating on the waters with
several small boats clinging to and following
after it. Some of the mountain-tops, not yet submerged,
are crowded with terror-stricken multitudes,
who, in their excitement, wildly but vainly
stretch out their hands and silently implore Noah
to take them in. Each of these pictures is realistic
and life-like. And yet the entire series is so
arranged as sweetly to blend into one harmonious
whole. And whether contemplating one of its
parts, or the scene as a whole, you involuntary
exclaim&mdash;“It is a thing of beauty,” and must
therefore be “a joy forever.”</p>

<p>Raphael was to the painters of Italy what
John was to the Disciples of Christ, “The Beloved.”
I think, too, that as John was the disciple,
so Raphael was the painter “whom Jesus loved.”
Though strong and determined as a man, he was
mild and gentle as a woman. He had the “Sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
of life” in his heart, and the “look of eternal
youth” in his face. Methinks he was like David,
“a man after God’s own heart.” Such a man
could not paint hell. He had not seen it and
knew nothing about it. His mission was to paint
angels and innocence, Heaven and holiness, God
and glory; and his fitness for this high calling
amounted almost to divine inspiration. Never
did the fires of genius burn more brightly upon
the altar of devotion, than in the breast of
Raphael. Never before, nor since, has divine
glory been so perfectly pictured on canvas as in
The Transfiguration. You see Christ at that
supreme moment when “His face did shine as the
sun, and His garments were white as the light.”
Moses and Elias, from the other world are there
with their happy hearts, bright faces and glorified
bodies. Below them are Peter, James, and John,
reverently bowing to the earth, and shielding their
faces from the light. Above all, but half enveloped
in clouds, you see God the Father whose very
expression says: “This is my beloved Son in
whom I am well pleased, hear ye Him.” Hawthorne
makes one of his characters in the <i>Marble
Faun</i> say: “It is the spectator’s mood that transfigures
The Transfiguration itself.” This may
be&mdash;I suppose it is&mdash;true, to some extent, but
somehow I was in the mood. I admired this
picture, I sat down before it “until it sank into my
heart.” I said: “Lord, it is good to be here, it
seems only one step from Heaven and Home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span></p>

<p>The beloved painter came to do what the beloved
Disciple left undone. John in his gospel
failed to mention the Transfiguration, so Raphael
was sent to fill up the omission with a picture.</p>

<p>While it is true, as stated in the outset, that
Art and Architecture are the chief features of
modern Rome, yet Art is of primary, and Architecture
of secondary consideration. Italians build
fine houses, not for the sake of the houses themselves,
but that they may display their “tasteful
talents” in ornamenting and decorating them. I
speak especially of churches, from the very fact
that the Italians have not, nor do they want, fine
Court-houses and costly Capitol buildings, as we
have. They exercise their taste, and lavish all
their wealth and art upon the churches or cathedrals.
There are eighty odd cathedrals in Rome
dedicated to the Virgin Mary alone. Besides
these there are scores of others dedicated to men,
and monks, seraphs, saints and sinners&mdash;one, I believe,
a small one, to Christ. Some of these,
St. Peter’s and St. Paul’s especially are reckoned
among the finest cathedrals in existence; and yet
the external appearance of these buildings is not
so imposing as one might imagine. It is their
interior that has rendered them famous.</p>

<p>Without entering these palaces of worship, one
can have no just conception of their resplendent
glory. They shine with burnished gold. They
glow with pictures. The mirror-like pavements
are a mosaic of rare workmanship. The walls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
columns, and arches seem a vast quarry of precious
stones, so rich and costly are the many-colored
marbles with which they are inlaid. Their
lofty cornices have flights of sculptured angels,
and white doves bearing green olive branches
gemmed with pearls and emeralds. And within
the vaults of the ceiling, and the swelling interior
of the dome, there are frescoes of such brilliancy,
and wrought with such artful perspective, that the
sky, peopled with sainted forms, appears to be
opened only a little way above the spectator.</p>

<p>Any one of the four churches mentioned has at
least a dozen altars&mdash;St. Peter’s has twenty-nine&mdash;and
upon each altar princely fortunes have been
lavished. Each is a marvel of artistic beauty;
each glows with burnished gold, and sparkles with
precious stones. The evening sun, softened and
mellowed by the many-colored glass through
which it is reflected, falls like golden fire upon
these shrines. The statues standing around and
the angels hovering above the altars seem warmed
into life by this radiant glow; the marble men
struggle to speak, and the sculptured angels
spread their wings and try to rise in the glorified
atmosphere. One would naturally think that, in
these shrines, the unspeakable splendor of the
whole edifice would be intensified and gathered
to a focus, but not so. It would be true elsewhere,
but here they are of no separate account.
They all “melt away into the vast, sunny breath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>”
each contributing its little toward “the grandeur
of the whole.”</p>

<p>Imagine “a casket, all inlaid in the inside with
precious stones of various hues, so that there
would not be a hair’s breadth of the small interior
unadorned with resplendent gems. Then conceive
this minute wonder of a mosaic box increased to
the magnitude of a miniature sky,” and you have
the interior of the greatest structure ever built
by the hands of man, the Cathedral of St. Peter.</p>

<p class="drop-capi12">THIS subject will awaken doubts in many
minds, and give rise to numerous questions.
Why should Italy be a mission-field? Did
not Paul preach the gospel there? Did not Christianity
flourish vigorously in Italian soil during
the early centuries? Has not Italy been prolific
of good men, men unsullied in character, invincible
in the midst of persecution, and unflinching
in the presence of death? Is not Italy the home
and headquarters of a great ecclesiastical organization,
calling itself <i>par excellence</i> the Christian
Church of the world? Are there not in Italy to-day
thousands of magnificent churches, hosts of
religious teachers? Then why speak of Italy as
a mission-field? Because the great mass of the
people are really without the Gospel. The pure
form of the truth once preached in Rome and
other parts of this sunny land has undergone such
radical changes since the early centuries that it is
no longer the Gospel, but a threefold mixture of
Christianity, Judaism and Heathenism. Religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
has degenerated into a mere form of Godliness
without the power thereof. All attempts at reform,
however promising in the beginning, have
failed. The spark that began to glow so brightly
in the days of Luther, that seemed about to
kindle into a brilliant flame destined to bring
light and peace to many a troubled soul, was
soon crushed and smothered, for those in authority
loved darkness rather than light, and desired
neither reform nor reformers. The long-continued
and fatal supremacy of Romanism has made
Italy a needy and most difficult mission-field.</p>

<p>As early as 1850, the Foreign Mission Board
of the Southern Baptist Convention began to
turn its attention to Europe. In 1869, the Board,
in its annual report to the Convention, expressed
the conviction that a solemn obligation was resting
upon Baptists to give a pure gospel to
Catholic Europe, and Italy was recommended as
probably the best place for a new mission, and as
a field in special need of Baptist principles. In
the spring of 1870, Rev. W. M. Cote, of Paris,
was appointed to take charge of the Italian mission.
This was a momentous period in the history
of Italy, and marvelous things were about to
take place. The great Ecumenical Council of
the Catholic Church was then in session in Rome,
and on July 18th the dogma of Papal Infallibility
was proclaimed to the world. A few days later
the Franco-Prussian war broke out, and the
French troops were withdrawn from Rome, where
for years they had been the strong defense of the
Pope. Seizing the God-given opportunity, Garibaldi,
ever ready for an emergency, again sounded
the tocsin of war, and the Italian army marched
forth and pitched its tents before the walls of the
Eternal City. The siege was brief, for on September
20th the victorious army entered the city
amid the cheers and congratulations of the entire
population; the Pope, by a popular vote, lost
his temporal power, and became the self-imposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
prisoner of the Vatican; Rome was proclaimed
the permanent capital of Italy, thus making
the long-cherished dream of Italian patriots
a blessed reality. This victory opened Rome
and the whole Italian Peninsula to the preaching
of the Gospel, and Christian workers from many
quarters hastened to the rescue. Dr. Cote entered
the city at once and began his novel work.
Tracts were distributed, Bibles and Testaments
were sold in large numbers, and hundreds flocked
to hear the Gospel. It seemed that the people
were about to renounce Romanism and its errors,
to become true Bible Christians, and the missionaries
fondly hoped that they were on the eve of a
great revival. Would that their hopes had been
well-founded!</p>

<p>In 1872, Rev. Geo. B. Taylor D. D., of Virginia,
was chosen by the Foreign Mission Board as the
man best suited to meet the crisis through which
the Italian mission was then passing. He brought
to his arduous task rare wisdom and patience,
and, undaunted by almost insuperable difficulties,
conducted the affairs of the mission with much
prudence and great self-denial. After several
years he succeeded in buying a valuable mission
property in Rome, not far from the Pantheon,
which gave American Baptists “a local habitation
and a name.” The good work was vigorously
prosecuted in other parts of Italy, new stations
were opened, other Italian evangelists were appointed,
new churches were organized, a religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
journal was established, and substantial progress
was made all along the line.</p>

<p>In November 1880, Rev. John H. Eager and
wife, appointed as missionaries to Italy, reached
Rome, where they have since resided and labored,
realizing more and more that mission work in
Papal Rome presents peculiar difficulties and
discouragements. Yet each year finds them more
resolved to make it their life work, assured that
they preach the same gospel which wrought such
wonders in pagan Rome, and believing the Scripture
which saith, “Be not weary in well-doing, for
in due season ye shall reap, if ye faint not.”</p>

<p>While results have not corresponded with the
sanguine expectations of earlier years, still God’s
people have not labored in vain. The present
working force of the American Baptist mission
consists of two missionaries, thirteen native
preachers, and three colporteurs, who are preaching
the Gospel in more than thirty cities and
towns, extending from the snow-capped mountains
of the North, to the vine-covered plains of
the South. Among the thirteen native preachers
are men of more than ordinary ability. One,
educated in Geneva, is a fine linguist, being acquainted
with six or seven languages, and able to
preach in three of them. He is said to be one of
the best Hebrew scholars in Italy. Another was
once a priest in high standing, the director and
father-confessor of a monastery, and a friend of the
present Pope. One, though uneducated, is deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
versed in the Scriptures, and can quote almost
any passage at will, giving book, chapter, and
often verse. This knowledge he uses most effectually
in public and in private. Two were educated
at Spurgeon’s College. One is perhaps the
only native Sardinian who ever became an evangelical
minister. These brethren preach to
thousands during the year, for people are coming
and going during every service. Some enter by
accident, or through curiosity, drawn in by the
singing or speaking, then pass on to be heard from
no more. But who can tell what influence such a
visit may have upon their future life?</p>

<p>Churches have been organized at all the principal
stations, and in addition to the mission property
in Rome two other chapels have been secured,
one in Torre Pellice, about thirty miles above
Turin, and the other in Carpi, not far from Bologna.
At all other stations services are held in
rented halls. Two churches have been organized
on the Island of Sardinia, where the work is peculiarity
interesting and promising, but greatly in
need of other laborers to sow the seed and reap
the harvest.</p>

<p>(Persons wishing further information about Sardinia or Italy, can write to
Rev. John H. Eager, via Arenula, Palazzo Gualdi, Rome, Italy.)</p>

<p>English Baptists have long had a mission in
Italy. In 1866, Mr. Clark established himself
in Spezia, where he has succeeded in building
up an excellent school, a good church and an
orphanage. He has associated with him eight
Italian evangelists, who occupy about twenty stations.
This mission is independent, being supported
by private contributions. The mission
force of the Particular Baptists of England consists
of four missionaries, Rev. James Wall and
Rev. J. C. Wall, of Rome, Rev. W. K. Landels of
Turin, and Rev. Robt. Walker of Naples, assisted
by nine native preachers. They have two medical
dispensaries, a religious journal, printing-press
and other auxiliaries to mission work. The General
Baptists of England also have two mission
stations in Rome, under the superintendence of
Rev. N. H. Shaw, who brings to bear upon his
work Anglo-Saxon energy, and the varied experience
acquired in a successful pastorate at home.</p>

<p>Besides these, several individual Baptists are
consecrating their private means to the evangelization
of Italy. Among them may be mentioned
Count Papengouth, who expends large sums annually
in Naples and vicinity; and Miss Emery,
an English lady of fortune, who devotes the whole
of her time and income to Christian work in Italy,
especially the publication and distribution of
tracts.</p>

<p>In estimating the success of mission work in
Italy, one should be careful not to lose sight of the
peculiar difficulties that confront the missionary.
Under the old regime, in the days of papal supremacy,
good schools were rare and great ignorance
prevailed. Even as late as 1881 nearly five per
cent. of the entire population of Italy were unable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
to read, which means that about twenty million
Italians can be reached with the Gospel only by
means of the living voice, the tracts and the Bible
being to them a dead letter.</p>

<p>Prejudice is another serious hindrance. Some
of the best and most sincere among the people
honestly believe that protestantism is rank infidelity.
A priest once said to a young man, in the
writers hearing, “Ah! beware of protestantism,
beware of protestantism! Why, don’t you know
that protestantism was founded by Voltaire and
Tom Paine?” The abuses of Romanism have
yielded a rich harvest of materialism and infidelity.
The salt has lost its savor and men have
cast it out and trodden it under foot. One of our
greatest difficulties, especially in Rome, lies in the
stolid indifference of the great mass of the people
to all spiritual things. Thousands have been
taught to depend on forms and ceremonies, and to
relegate all personal responsibility to the Church
and the priest, and to such our doctrines are by
no means acceptable.</p>

<p>In a land like Italy, where a great system of
error has kept the people in ignorance and spiritual
darkness, and bound them with fetters of iron,
one must not expect too much. A few days ago,
we were asked by a Christian woman, “How are
you succeeding in your work?” And on hearing
the response she replied: “I know Rome well,
and I can assure you that it is a great marvel that
you can do anything at all.” But despite difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
and Satanic hatred and opposition much has
been done. Italy has become a united and free
country and liberty of speech is everywhere enjoyed;
the Pope has lost his temporal power, and
with it the right to interfere with the missionary
of the Cross; hundreds and thousands of
tracts and Bibles have been scattered among the
people, as silent but powerful witnesses for the
Truth; prejudices have been overcome, and public
opinion has been greatly modified and enlightened
with reference to protestants and protestantism;
more than three hundred Christian workers
have been raised upon the field, and not less than
10,000 persons have professed faith in Christ. It
should not be forgotten that previous to 1848 not
one publicly declared Italian evangelical could
be found in Italy, and that before 1870, to preach
or profess evangelical doctrine in Rome, meant
certain imprisonment and possible death. While
praying and hoping and earnestly laboring for
much greater results, we can but exclaim, “The
Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we
are glad.”</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi15">WITH our face to the northward, we are now
skirting along the western coast of Italy.
The air is crisp and cold, the sky soft and
clear. Yonder, scattered over the bare hillside to
our right, are many rude huts and humble peasant
homes. The smoke slowly rising from the
low chimneys curls up and on, and still up, until
it stands like so many slender columns leaning
against the sky for support.</p>

<p>The peasants are at work, one feeding the
chickens, the second holding the cow to grass,
while the third is milking the goats. Everywhere
the country is cut up into one, two, and three-acre
plots by narrow ditches and low hedges
which serve as fences to divide one peasant’s
patch from another. Each plot of ground is a
vineyard, a wheat field and a mulberry orchard,
the three growing together.</p>

<p>The wheat is, of course, sown broadcast. The
trees, twelve to eighteen feet high, are planted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
straight rows, fifteen feet apart. The healthy
vines clamber up the mulberries, and wreathe
themselves into huge and rich festoons from tree
to tree. The ground rapidly glides from under
us, the orchards, the villages and peasant homes,
one by one dash by us. Now the sun is bending
low in the evening sky, and, looking out over the
broad expanse of waters on our left, we see not
far away the island of Elba, the first exiled home
of Napoleon Bonaparte. But this beautiful island
was too small for so great a spirit. After
one year’s confinement here, Napoleon, rising up
in his madness and might, broke the political
fetters which the allied Powers had placed upon
him, returned to Paris, gathered an army and
marched to Waterloo. There his already waning
star went down in blood to rise no more (1815).</p>

<p>As the dying day begins to wrap herself in the
sombre folds of evening, we find ourselves in
Pisa, a quiet little town of 26,000 inhabitants,
beautifully situated on both banks of the Arno,
six miles from the sea. The night comes and
goes. Next morning I am standing on the top
of Pisa’s “Leaning Tower,” in time to see the sun
rise. This tower is one of the wonders, not of
the ancient, but modern world. It is some thirty-three
feet in diameter and one hundred and
eighty feet in height, and leans thirteen feet out
of the perpendicular. This oblique or leaning
position gives it a very peculiar appearance. It
looks as if it were falling; you expect every moment
to see it dashed to pieces against the ground.
But it has been in this position some 650 years,
and, if we may argue from the past, many moons
will wax and wane before it strikes the ground.
No one knows whether the original design was to
build a leaning tower, or whether in the course of
construction one side of the foundation gave way,
and thus left the tower in an oblique position.
It was by dropping balls from the summit of this
tower that Galileo verified his theories regarding
the laws of gravitation. It was the swaying of
the bronze lamp which still hangs in the cathedral
at the foot of this tower that first suggested to
Galileo the idea of a pendulum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span></p>

<p>The Campo Santo, or burial-ground, of Pisa is
interesting because of its history. After the Crusaders
were driven out of the Holy Land, in the
year 1190, Archbishop Ubaldo had fifty-three
ship-loads of earth brought hither from Mount
Calvary in order that the dead might repose in
“holy ground.” What men need to-day is not
the earth of Calvary for their dead bodies, but
the Christ of Calvary for their living spirits.</p>

<p>Three hours after leaving Pisa, I am walking
through the streets of Florence, looking at
her monuments, statues, palaces and cathedrals.
Among the monuments, if so it might be named,
is a splendid water fountain which marks the site
of the stake at which Savonarola was burned, in
1498, six years after the discovery of America.
Like Elijah of old, Savonarola went from earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
to Heaven in a chariot of fire. The flames that
wafted his spirit to the glory world are still
burning brightly upon the pages of history. The
martyr’s ashes were thrown into the Arno, and
were carried thence to the ocean. So the stream
of Time will bear his influence on to the ocean of
eternity.</p>

<p>Of the many statues in the city, I will mention
only Dante’s. This excellent statue of white marble
is nine feet high, on a pedestal twenty-three
feet high. It was unveiled with great solemnity,
in 1865, in commemoration of the 600th anniversary
of the immortal poet. Dante’s greatest work
was the “Divine Comedy.” I also visited the
house in which he was born in 1265. The house
in which Michael Angelo was born in 1475 is now
used as a picture gallery. He died in Rome in
1564. His ashes were brought back to his native
city, and now repose in a vault in the church of
Santa Croce.</p>

<p>The art galleries I found worthy of their fame,
so beautiful in architectural design, so vast in extent,
so rich in the productions of the best artists
of every school. “Each street of Florence contains
a world of art. The walls of the city are the
calyx containing the fairest flowers of the human
mind; and this is but the richest gem in the diadem
with which the Italian people have adorned
the earth.” Florence has been the home of many
of the greatest artists that have lived since the
twelfth century. The main centres of art in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
Florence are the Pitti and the Uffizi galleries;
these, being on the opposite sides of the Arno,
are connected by a suspension gallery which spans
the river. Thus one passes from one gallery to
the other by means of this swinging corridor,
which is itself flanked on both sides with faultless
statues and lined with pictures that no money
could buy.</p>

<p>I wandered, one day after another, through the
stately halls of many-colored marble in Florence.
Many of these pictures I should like to show you,
but I know full well that words can not copy
them. To copy Raphael’s “Madonna” would require
the hand of genius, and paints as beautiful,
and as delicately mixed, as are the colors of the
rainbow.</p>

<p>“Variety is the spice of life,” and truly it is refreshing
to come to this land of Art and Music
after spending a few months in Asia and Africa.
Since leaving home, more of my time has been
spent among the mountains and around the lakes
than in the cities; or, in other words,</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“I have been accustomed to entwine<br />
My thoughts with Nature rather in the fields<br />
Than art in galleries.”</p>

<p class="p1">“On to Venice” is the war cry. To reach there,
we tunnel mountains, dash through a blinding
snow-storm, and encounter a heavy rainfall. Presently
we are surrounded by water. The train
stops. Johnson is excited; he thinks the bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
is washed away. Looking out of the window, and
pointing to the water, I ask a by-stander, “Is that
the ocean?” The reply is, “No; it is Venice.”
“A flood!” exclaims Johnson; “if it continues to
rain in this way two hours longer, the whole city
will be washed away, and we, where will we be?”
By this time, as there is a gondola near, we, like
Jonah, pay the fare thereof, and go down into
it. We are soon on the way to the hotel.</p>

<p>The storm is raging, the waves are dashing
high. The gondola, which is black, and really reminds
one of a hearse, seems to be bearing us
away to a watery grave. The boat must be
lightened, or we will all go down. What to do, I
know not. Hope wanes. “My latest sun is sinking
fast.” In the extremity of that hour, I say:
“This I will do. I will throw overboard all
hatred, envy and strife, all contention, malice
and jealousy, all egotism, selfishness and pride.”
When I have emptied my heart of all these, a
surprising change occurs. It is as if some divine
one has whispered, “Peace, be still.”</p>

<p>Reader, this experience points a moral, if it
does not adorn a tale. We are all voyagers on
the Sea of Life. Tempests frequently come, and
our frail bark is often threatened; but if we will
only throw overboard our ignoble feelings and
baser selves, a holy calm will settle on the face
of the deep, and in our hearts we will have that
“peace which passeth all understanding.”</p>

<p>Venice, you remember, is situated two miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
from the mainland, in a shallow part of the Adriatic.
Its 15,000 houses and palaces are built on
117 islands. Streets are unknown. There are
150 canals and 380 bridges in the city. The population
is 130,000, one-fourth of whom are paupers.</p>

<p>Yes, here is Venice rising above the surface like
a water nymph, and floating like a sea fowl on
the ocean wave. She was once the ruler of the
waters and their powers. Those days are past,
but beauty is still here. “States fall, arts fade,
but nature doth not die.” There was never a
horse, carriage, or wheel-barrow in the city. I
presume there are half grown persons here who
never saw any of these. The Venetians go visiting
in boats, they go to market, to church, to the
theatre, to the grave, in boats.</p>

<p>The houses rise up out of the water; the gondola,
graceful in its motion as a serpent, glides up
to the door, the people step in, and off they go.
The gondola is a contrivance peculiar to Venice.
It is twenty-five or thirty feet long, and is deep
and narrow like a canoe. Its sharp bow and
stern sweep upwards from the water like the
horns of a crescent, with the abruptness of the
curve slightly modified. The bow, which rises
some six feet above the water, is ornamented with
a steel comb and a broad battle ax. In the centre
of the boat is a little house something like the
body of a carriage. This is elegantly fitted up with
cushioned seats, silk curtains, and glass windows.
The gondolier, who is usually a picturesque rascal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
stands erect in the stern of the boat, and with one
oar he manages to guide and propel his boat with
an accuracy and a speed that are truly surprising.
Almost every moment you expect your gondola
to collide with some other; but by some timely
turn the two glide gracefully by each other without
touching. All the gondolas are painted black&mdash;the
color of mourning. Well may Venice mourn.
Her glory has departed. She is great only in
history.</p>

<p>The chief industry of Venice is glass manufacture.
The first glass mirror that was ever made
was manufactured here about the year 1,300.
The Venetians are yet ahead in this kind of work.
They now make men and monkeys, horses and
houses, doves and donkeys, of glass. I saw them
spinning glass; and without handling the thread
one could not tell it from silk. They fashion glass
into buds and blossoms which need little else than
perfume to make them as perfect as those wrought
by Nature’s hand. Perhaps the most delicate
glass work I saw going on was the manufacture
of human eyes. This, you may rest assured, requires
skilled workmen. It is a large and remunerative
business. God and Venice furnish eyes
for the world. In bargaining with the glass dealers,
one soon finds that now, as in the days of
Shakespeare, many Shylocks live in Venice, and
each one contends for his “pound of flesh.”</p>

<p>If I had time to write another chapter concerning
this “Ocean Queen,” I would tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
something about the Bridge of Sighs “with a
palace and a prison on each hand,” about St.
Mark’s Cathedral, which “looks more like the
work of angels than of men,” about the granite
columns, one surmounted by “the winged lion and
the other by St. Theodore, the protector of the
republic.” Of course it is a great pity (?) that
you can not read what I would write on these
subjects if I had time, but, as this is impossible,
perhaps the next best thing you could read would
be “Childe Harold,” “Stones of Venice,” and “St.
Mark’s Rest.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
